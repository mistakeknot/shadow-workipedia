# Infrastructure

## Overview

The Infrastructure system tracks physical networks—roads, ports, power grids, communications—that enable economic activity and state capacity.

## What It Simulates

- **Transportation networks (roads, rail, ports, airports)**
- **Energy infrastructure (power plants, grids, pipelines)**
- **Communications (internet, telecom)**
- **Water and sanitation systems**

## How It Affects Gameplay

- Infrastructure investment enables growth
- Network vulnerabilities create cascade risks
- Modernization vs. maintenance tradeoffs

## System Connections

This system has 22 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.

*Connected issues and related systems are automatically populated from the graph.*
