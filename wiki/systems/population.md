# Population

## Overview

The Population System simulates demographic dynamics using full actuarial modeling with 101 age cohorts (0-100+) per country. It models births, deaths, aging, international migration, and urbanization through interconnected sub-systems.



## System Connections

This system has 29 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.

*Connected issues and related systems are automatically populated from the graph.*
