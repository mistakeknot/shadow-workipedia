# Economy

## Overview

The Economy system models production, consumption, trade, and wealth distribution across nations. It tracks GDP, inequality, employment, and financial stability - forming the backbone of a country's material capacity to address other challenges.

## What It Simulates

- **Production & GDP**: National output based on labor, capital, resources, and technology
- **Wealth Distribution**: Gini coefficient, class stratification, and social mobility
- **Employment**: Labor market dynamics, automation effects, and workforce composition
- **Financial Stability**: Banking health, debt levels, and market volatility
- **Informal Economy**: Black markets, tax evasion, and unregulated labor

## How It Affects Gameplay

**Player Levers:**
- Tax policy adjustments (progressive vs. flat)
- Trade agreements and tariffs
- Labor regulations and minimum wage
- Banking and financial regulation
- Infrastructure investment priorities

**Warning Indicators:**
- Rising inequality (Gini > 0.45)
- Unemployment spikes (> 15%)
- Debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding 100%
- Currency instability and inflation
- Capital flight signals

**Win/Loss Conditions:**
- Economic collapse triggers cascading failures in healthcare, education, and stability
- Extreme inequality leads to social unrest and political instability
- Sustained growth with low inequality enables investment in other systems
