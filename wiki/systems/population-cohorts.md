# Population (Cohorts)

## Overview

The Population (Cohorts) subsystem extends the core Population system with specialized modeling of cohorts dynamics. It tracks detailed interactions that affect how population evolves.



## System Connections

This system has 3 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.
