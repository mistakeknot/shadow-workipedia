# Technology

## Overview

The Technology System uses a **Network Diffusion Model** where technology spreads through relationship networks (trade, alliances, espionage, brain drain). Countries advance through domains (gradual progress) and breakthroughs (paradigm shifts). Competition pressure from conflicts and crises accelerates specific domains, creating emergent arms races and crisis-driven innovation.



## System Connections

This system has 31 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.
