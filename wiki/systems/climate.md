# Climate

## Overview

Cross-domain policy feedbacks shared with the politics/trust systems are documented in `docs/technical/simulation-systems/00-shared-climate-politics-policy.md`. The Climate System operates on geological timescales, tracking cumulative carbon emissions and their impact on global and regional temperatures. It generates extreme weather events that affect economic productivity.



## System Connections

This system has 19 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.
