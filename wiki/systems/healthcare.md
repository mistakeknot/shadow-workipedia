# Healthcare

## Overview

The Healthcare System models national healthcare capacity as **granular resources** (ICU beds, ventilators, healthcare workers) rather than abstract scalars. It handles **surge capacity** during crises (pandemics, natural disasters, wars), **triage protocols** when demand exceeds capacity, **healthcare worker burnout and attrition**, and **mortality multipliers** from healthcare collapse.



## System Connections

This system has 1 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.
