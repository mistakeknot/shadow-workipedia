# Geography

## Overview

The Geography system models physical terrain, natural resources distribution, strategic locations, and how geographical features shape political and economic possibilities.

## What It Simulates

- **Terrain types and natural barriers**
- **Resource distribution and accessibility**
- **Strategic chokepoints and trade routes**
- **Climate zones and habitability**

## How It Affects Gameplay

- Geographic advantages/disadvantages shape development paths
- Resource locations drive conflict and cooperation
- Natural barriers affect military and trade

## System Connections

This system has 10 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.

*Connected issues and related systems are automatically populated from the graph.*
