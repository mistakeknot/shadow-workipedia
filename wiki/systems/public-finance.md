# Public Finance

## Overview

## What It Simulates

- **Tax revenue and collection efficiency**
- **Government spending priorities**
- **Sovereign debt and borrowing**
- **Budget deficits and surpluses**

## How It Affects Gameplay

- Fiscal capacity determines state options
- Debt crises trigger austerity or default
- Tax policy shapes economic incentives

## System Connections

This system has 19 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.
