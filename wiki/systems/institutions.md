# Institutions

## Overview

The Institutions System implements **Layer 2** of Shadow Work's four-layer simulation architecture (Individuals → **Institutions** → Population Cohorts → Global Systems). It models ~800-1,000 institutions across 228 countries as living entities with cultures, memories, and relationships that evolve over decades.



## System Connections

This system has 14 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.

*Connected issues and related systems are automatically populated from the graph.*
