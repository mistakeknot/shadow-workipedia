# Homelessness Crisis Response

## Overview

The Homelessness Crisis Response system models housing instability, shelter systems, and policy responses to chronic and acute homelessness.

## What It Simulates

- **Housing affordability and availability**
- **Shelter and supportive services**
- **Mental health and addiction intersections**
- **Policy interventions and effectiveness**

## How It Affects Gameplay

- Housing-first vs. conditional approaches
- Cost-benefit of prevention vs. response
- Visibility drives political pressure

## System Connections

This system has 6 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.

*Connected issues and related systems are automatically populated from the graph.*
