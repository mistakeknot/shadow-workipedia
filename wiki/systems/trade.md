# Trade

## Overview

The Trade system models international commerce, supply chains, trade agreements, and the economic interdependencies between nations.

## What It Simulates

- **Import/export flows and trade balances**
- **Supply chain networks and vulnerabilities**
- **Trade agreements and tariffs**
- **Currency exchange and financial flows**

## How It Affects Gameplay

- Trade creates mutual dependencies
- Supply chain disruptions cascade globally
- Trade policy as economic and political tool

## System Connections

This system has 10 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.

*Connected issues and related systems are automatically populated from the graph.*
