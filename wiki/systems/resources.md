# Resources

## Overview

The Resources system models natural resource extraction, depletion, trade, and the economic/political consequences of resource abundance or scarcity.

## What It Simulates

- **Fossil fuels, minerals, and rare earths**
- **Renewable resources and sustainability**
- **Resource depletion and discovery**
- **Resource curse dynamics**

## How It Affects Gameplay

- Resource wealth can fund development or fuel corruption
- Depletion timelines force transition planning
- Resource dependencies create vulnerabilities

## System Connections

This system has 16 connections to other systems in the simulation graph. These connections represent data flows, dependencies, and feedback loops that create emergent behavior.

*Connected issues and related systems are automatically populated from the graph.*
