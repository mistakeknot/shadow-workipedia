# Homelessness Crisis

Homelessness has evolved from a marginal social issue to a visible, multi-dimensional crisis affecting cities nationwide. Encampments proliferate in public spaces, shelter capacity lags demand by 40-60%, and policy debates fracture between Housing First advocates and treatment-first proponents. The visible presence of tent cities, rising unsheltered populations, and criminalization policies create moral, public health, and political flashpoints.

The numbers tell a stark story: HUD's 2023 count identified 653,000 homeless individuals on a single night, a 12% increase from 2022 and the highest since tracking began. Unsheltered homelessness grew 23% in major cities, with encampments becoming permanent fixtures under highways, in parks, and along waterfronts. The crisis intersects with opioid addiction, mental illness, housing affordability, and criminal justice policy, creating a multi-causal web resistant to single-intervention solutions. Cities spend $30,000-$50,000 per homeless individual annually on emergency services, policing, and shelter, yet outcomes worsen.

Policy approaches bifurcate into incompatible paradigms. Housing First provides permanent housing without preconditions, citing 85% retention rates and cost savings. Treatment-first models require sobriety, mental health compliance, and job training before housing access, arguing that addiction and mental illness must be addressed to sustain housing. Criminalization ordinances ban camping, vehicle dwelling, and panhandling, displacing encampments without providing alternatives. These competing visions reflect deeper ideological divides about personal responsibility, government's role, and whether housing is a right or an earned privilege.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

- **Social Stability (Visible Homelessness)**: -40 to -75 as encampments proliferate
  - Public parks, transit stations become uninhabitable for housed residents
  - Business districts report declining foot traffic, property values

- **Public Health (Communicable Disease)**: -35 to -65 in encampment zones
  - Hepatitis A outbreaks from unsanitary conditions
  - TB, COVID-19 spread accelerated in congregate shelters

- **Legal System (Criminalization)**: -30 to -60 as enforcement escalates
  - Arrest/citation cycles without housing alternatives
  - Court backlogs, jail overcrowding from camping ordinance violations

- **Economy (Emergency Services)**: -25 to -50 from crisis response costs
  - Paramedic calls, ER visits for homeless individuals 3-5x general population
  - Police spending on encampment enforcement, sweeps

- **Infrastructure (Shelter Capacity)**: -50 to -80 as demand outpaces supply
  - Shelter waitlists 30-90 days in major cities
  - Year-round overflow shelters in churches, gymnasiums

- **Mental Health (Treatment Access)**: -40 to -70 for homeless population
  - 25-30% of homeless have severe mental illness
  - Community mental health systems lack capacity for outreach, housing support

### Cascading Effects

**To Public Health Crisis**: Encampment sanitation failures create communicable disease outbreaks (Hep A, TB) that spread beyond homeless population into broader community.

**To Criminal Justice Overload**: Criminalization ordinances flood courts, jails with homeless defendants, creating arrest-release-arrest cycles without addressing root causes.

**To Housing Affordability Crisis**: Homelessness becomes visible consequence of housing unaffordability, political pressure for rent control, inclusionary zoning, but NIMBY resistance blocks new shelter construction.

**To Mental Health System Collapse**: 25-30% of homeless have severe mental illness, but community mental health systems lack capacity for assertive outreach, housing support services.

**From Opioid Crisis**: Addiction drives homelessness as individuals lose housing, employment; fentanyl wave increases overdose deaths in encampments, strains emergency services.

**From Economic Recession**: Job losses, evictions during downturns convert housed individuals to homelessness faster than systems can respond, overwhelming shelters and services.

## Warning Signs

**Tent City Proliferation (60+ days until major encampments)**
- Unsheltered homelessness growing >10% YoY
- Shelter waitlists exceeding 21 days
- Small encampments appearing in parks, under overpasses
- City purchasing portable toilets, handwashing stations for encampment zones

**Housing Policy Battle (90+ days until council vote)**
- Homelessness funding RFP released with competing approaches
- Advocacy groups mobilizing for Housing First vs. Treatment First
- Media coverage framing policy debate as ideological battle
- Council members staking positions publicly

**Criminalization Push (120+ days until ordinance passage)**
- Business improvement district lobbying for camping bans
- New mayor/city council elected on "livability" platform
- Public safety committees holding hearings on encampments
- Legal counsel drafting anti-camping ordinances post-*Martin v. Boise*

**Shelter System Collapse (30+ days until crisis)**
- Shelter capacity <65% of demand during non-winter months
- Overflow shelters operating past seasonal closure dates
- Hypothermia deaths reported, media coverage intensifies
- Emergency services reporting increased homeless-related calls

**Disease Outbreak Imminent (45+ days until public health emergency)**
- Hep A cases among homeless increasing >50% MoM
- Encampment sanitation complaints to health department rising
- Portable toilet/handwashing station requests exceeding supply
- TB screening positivity rates among homeless >15%

**Service Provider Collapse (180+ days until major closures)**
- Shelter staff turnover >35% annually
- Case manager vacancies unfilled >90 days
- Nonprofits reporting cash flow problems, delayed contracts
- Merger/closure rumors among homeless service agencies
