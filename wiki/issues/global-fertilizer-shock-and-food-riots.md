# Global Fertilizer Shock and Food Riots

## Overview

A sudden, severe disruption in global fertilizer supply chains triggers cascading food production failures, price spikes, and widespread civil unrest across vulnerable regions. This shock operates through multiple pathways: geopolitical sanctions isolating major fertilizer producers (Russia, Belarus, China), supply-chain bottlenecks in phosphate and potash mining, hoarding by agricultural-dependent states, and speculative commodity trading amplifying price volatility. Within 6–12 months, fertilizer prices spike 150–300% above baseline, forcing farmers to reduce application rates or abandon crops mid-season. Global grain yields decline 15–40% regionally, creating food availability crises in 45+ countries simultaneously. As governments fail to stabilize prices or ensure domestic food security, rural populations starve, urban food riots explode (30,000+ participants common), and social contracts collapse in vulnerable regions. Authoritarian regimes impose martial law and food rationing; democratic governments face electoral upheaval and legitimacy crises. The shock reveals the fragility of just-in-time agricultural systems: a 4–8 week supply chain interruption cascades into months of production failure. International governance mechanisms freeze as exporting nations hoard food and importing nations compete for dwindling supplies through military and economic coercion.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Fertilizer Price Index**: Spikes 2–3x within 3–6 months when supply chain disruption occurs. Recovery to baseline takes 18–36 months if supply chain normalizes; permanent shifts likely if geopolitical tensions remain unresolved. Regional variation: phosphate-dependent regions (Middle East, North Africa) experience 4–5x spikes; potash-dependent regions (Eastern Europe, India) face 2.5–3.5x spikes.

- **Agricultural Productivity**: Declines 15–40% regionally when fertilizer shortage coincides with growing season. Decline is non-linear: a 40% reduction in fertilizer application causes 20–35% yield loss (crops fail before food runs out). Subsistence farming regions experience steeper declines (35–50%) due to inability to adapt; industrial agriculture maintains 10–25% productivity loss through crop selection and irrigation shifts.

- **Food Price Index**: Global increases 25–60% within 6 months as yield failures and panic buying combine. Regional variation: grain-importing regions (Middle East, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa) experience 40–80% increases; grain-exporting regions (US, Argentina, Ukraine) see 15–35% increases initially, then steep increases as export demand exceeds supply.

- **Civil Unrest Index**: Rises 8–15 points per 20% increase in food prices. Triggers mass riots, strikes, and militia formation in regions where food spending exceeds 40% of household income (most of Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, parts of Middle East). Regime stability declines 3–5 points per month if food security isn't restored within 3 months.

- **International Trade Tension**: Spikes 5–8 points as exporting nations impose export controls and hoarding begins. Trade wars escalate as importing nations implement price controls, currency manipulation, and military coercion to secure food shipments. Regional trading blocs realign away from affected regions.

- **Migration Pressure**: Increases 2–4x in food-deficit regions. Rural-to-urban migration accelerates as farms fail; cross-border migration to food-secure regions increases 50–150% within 6–12 months, creating refugee crises and border militarization.

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **global-hunger-crisis** when fertilizer shortage persists >6 months + food prices increase >60%
- Amplifies **food-export-weaponization** by 40–70% as exporting nations realize food control as leverage, formalizing export bans and price-gouging as policy
- Triggers **agricultural-collapse** when rural farm abandonment exceeds 25% regionally or fertilizer application drops >50% across growing season
- Amplifies **sanctions-regime** by 30–50% as food security becomes justification for military intervention or counter-sanctions
- Accelerates **social-instability-spirals** by 25–40% through simultaneous riots across multiple regions, overwhelming security forces and collapsing local authority
- Triggers **mass-migration-crises** when food deficit regions experience >15% population displacement toward food-secure areas
- Amplifies **authoritarian-consolidation** by 20–35% as regimes impose martial law and suppress dissent under cover of "emergency food security measures"

## Interconnected Mechanisms

**The Fertilizer-Price-Unrest Cascade:**
1. Supply disruption (sanctions, strike, accident) reduces fertilizer availability by 30–50%
2. Prices spike 150–250% as buyers panic and hoard
3. Farmers reduce application rates or skip season entirely (can't afford inputs)
4. Crop yields decline 20–40% regionally 3–6 months later
5. Food availability drops; prices spike 40–80% as supply contracts
6. Urban populations in vulnerable regions (>50% food spending) face actual hunger
7. Riots, strikes, militia formation cascade across 15–30 cities within weeks
8. Governments impose rationing, price controls, export bans (attempt to stabilize)
9. Production collapse accelerates as controls reduce farmer incentive
10. Famine conditions emerge in 3–12 months if supply chain not restored

**Regional Asymmetries:**
- **High-income agricultural exporters** (US, EU, Argentina): Weather short-term price spikes; retain food security through hoarding, contracts, and market power; limited civil unrest; leverage food exports as political tool
- **Import-dependent middle-income regions** (Middle East, North Africa, South Asia): Face 3–5x price spikes; import bills skyrocket; limited foreign exchange to secure supplies; widespread malnutrition and civil unrest within 3–6 months
- **Poorest, least-connected regions** (Sub-Saharan Africa, parts of South Asia): Face famine within 3–4 months; rely on food aid and imports; completely unable to absorb price shocks; state collapse and mass migration common

**Feedback Loops:**
- **Shortages → Rationing → Black Markets**: Government rationing creates artificial scarcity and incentivizes smuggling; elite corruption flourishes; poor can't access rationed food; production further declines as farmers sell on black market instead of to government
- **Farmers Abandon Crops → Future Supply Shortages**: Initial fertilizer shortage forces farmers to reduce planting; next season's reduced planting means even lower supply 12 months later, extending crisis duration 24–36 months minimum
- **Panic Buying → Hoarding → Shortage Spiral**: Early awareness of shortage triggers purchasing surge; inventory depletes faster; late participants can't access supply; panic spreads to surrounding regions as transport congestion amplifies shortages

## Warning Signs

**Pre-Crisis Indicators (3–12 months before major disruption):**

- **Fertilizer Futures Volatility + Geopolitical Instability** = Price swings >20% month-over-month; major producer (Russia, Belarus, China) sanctioned or internally disrupted; major exporter restricts shipments due to currency/political risk. Probability of supply shock >70%.

- **Agricultural Debt Spikes + Farmer Vulnerability** = Fertilizer costs exceed 40% of input costs for marginal farmers; many operating on credit; unable to absorb >30% price increase. Cascade: widespread loan defaults within 6 months if prices spike >50%.

- **Supply Chain Bottlenecks + Depleted Reserves** = Port congestion (Suez, Baltic, Shanghai) delays fertilizer shipments 4–8 weeks; global fertilizer reserves at <30-day supply (historically 45–60 days); transportation costs spike 50%+. System operating at capacity with zero buffer for disruption.

- **Export Controls Signals + Regional Hoarding** = Major exporters signal possible restrictions on fertilizer exports; importing nations announce purchasing surges or government stockpiling; spot market prices exceed futures prices by 15%+. Indicates imminent panic buying and shortage spiral.

**Cascade Indicators (Shock in Progress):**

- **Fertilizer Prices >150% Spike + Panic Buying** = Supply disruption occurs; prices spike 150%+ within 2–4 weeks; agricultural input suppliers report depleted inventory; farmers can't secure necessary supplies. Crisis mode: widespread farm abandonment begins.

- **Urban Food Price Spikes >40% + Riot Indicators** = Food prices increase >40% within 4–8 weeks; poor households face actual calorie reduction; social media reports of food riots or protests in 3+ major cities; government imposes price controls (indicates panic). Riots within weeks if >50% of poor population at caloric deficit.

- **Government Rationing + Market Collapse** = Government imposes rationing or price controls; farmers unable to sell at profitable price; planting rates drop sharply; government stockpiles depleted within 4–6 months. Long-term collapse: supplies won't recover for 18–24 months.

- **Export Controls + Trade War Escalation** = Exporting nations restrict food sales; importing nations threaten military or economic coercion; trade war narratives dominate political discourse; food becomes weaponized. Regional isolation: affected regions can't access imports; prices spike to 5–10x baseline.

**Specific Indicators of Regional Vulnerability to Crisis:**

- **High Food Import Dependency + Limited Foreign Exchange** = Region imports >40% of calories; foreign exchange reserves <6 months of import costs; currency under pressure. Crisis impact: malnutrition risk >50% population within 3 months if supply restricted.

- **Large Vulnerable Urban Populations + High Food Spending Ratios** = Megacities (10M+) with >50% population in informal settlements; food spending >50% of household income common. Crisis impact: food riots probable if prices spike >60% within 4–8 weeks.

- **Fragile Agricultural Systems + Climate Stress** = Farmers relying on synthetic fertilizer for 80%+ of productivity (no fallback to traditional methods); concurrent climate stress (drought, flooding, pest outbreaks); low crop diversity. Crisis impact: harvest failures cascade across multiple crops simultaneously; total production collapse likely.

- **Weak Government Capacity + Political Instability** = Government lacking resources for food subsidy or emergency response; active civil conflict or election-related instability; security forces under-resourced. Crisis impact: state capacity overwhelmed; martial law and collapse common.
