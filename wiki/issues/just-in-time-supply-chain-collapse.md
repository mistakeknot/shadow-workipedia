# Just-in-Time Supply Chain Collapse

## Overview

Just-in-Time (JIT) manufacturing represents a fundamental vulnerability in modern global supply chains. By design, JIT systems minimize inventory buffers and rely on precise, predictable logistics networks to deliver components exactly when they're needed. This operational efficiency has driven three decades of cost reduction across automotive, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and consumer goods manufacturing. However, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed a catastrophic fragility: when a single node in the global supply network fails—whether from factory closure, port congestion, geopolitical disruption, or natural disaster—entire industries grind to a halt within weeks.

The semiconductor shortage of 2021-2023 exemplified this vulnerability. Taiwan produces 92% of advanced semiconductor capacity; when geopolitical tensions with China escalated, multiple production facilities experienced minor disruptions, yet global automakers faced $210+ billion in lost production and lost sales. Companies with JIT-dependent supply chains (Tesla, Ford, BMW) experienced 20-40% production cuts, while competitors with strategic inventory buffers (Toyota) lost only 2-5% capacity. This asymmetry revealed that JIT is not inherently superior—it is merely cheaper during periods of stability.

As of 2025, the supply chain ecosystem remains structurally brittle. Reshoring efforts remain incomplete; 68% of critical components still originate from single-source or two-source suppliers concentrated in high-risk geographies (Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Mexico). Port congestion, labor shortages in logistics, geopolitical tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea, climate disruptions affecting major transport corridors (Panama Canal, Suez, Rhine), and potential decoupling of US-China trade relationships create cascading failure modes. A sustained disruption lasting 90+ days would force automotive production cuts of 15-25% globally and shortages in consumer electronics affecting 40-60% of planned product launches.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Supply Chain Resilience Index**: JIT-dependent industries experience 0.5-1.2% quarterly GDP loss for each month of sustained supply disruption (>30 days). Switching to resilient supply models (strategic inventory, geographic diversification, nearshoring) increases costs by 3-8% but reduces disruption impact by 60-75%. Resilience builds gradually through investment over 18-36 months.

- **Manufacturing Capacity Utilization**: Disruptions cause cascading idleness: when a critical input is unavailable, downstream factories reduce utilization from 85-90% to 40-60% within 1-2 weeks, forcing layoffs or extended shutdowns. Recovery lags supply restoration by 4-8 weeks as confidence rebuilds and inventory buffers are replenished.

- **Geopolitical Risk Premium**: Each regional conflict, tariff escalation, or hostile government action increases supply chain risk premiums by 2-5 percentage points, raising logistics costs and triggering strategic inventory buildup. Taiwan tensions increase semiconductor input costs by 3-6%; US-China trade escalation raises manufacturing costs by 4-9%.

- **Consumer Price Index**: Supply disruptions flow to consumers within 60-90 days. A 3-month supply disruption in automotive components increases car prices by 2-4%; semiconductor shortage increases consumer electronics prices by 8-15%. Price spikes erode consumer purchasing power and trigger demand destruction lasting 6-12 months post-recovery.

- **Employment in Manufacturing**: Disruptions force temporary layoffs (weeks to months), creating wage pressure as rehiring occurs. Sustained disruptions (>90 days) trigger permanent losses of 2-5% manufacturing workforce as companies relocate or automate. Workforce turnover increases hiring and training costs by 15-25% post-recovery.

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **pandemic-disruption** when transportation hubs close or logistics workers face shortage; magnifies pandemic impact by 25-35% in supply-dependent sectors
- Amplifies **semiconductor-shortage** by 40-60% if disruption affects Taiwan or Korea; can create secondary shortages in automotive, consumer electronics, defense
- Triggers **manufacturing-employment-collapse** when disruption persists >90 days; unemployment in manufacturing regions increases 2-4 percentage points
- Amplifies **consumer-price-inflation** by 4-8 percentage points during acute disruption phases, persisting 6-18 months post-recovery
- Triggers **geopolitical-instability** escalation when supply cuts are weaponized (sanctions, export controls), increasing international tensions by 15-25%
- Amplifies **reshoring-movement** by 35-50% when disruption occurs, accelerating long-term supply chain decoupling and increasing costs 3-8%
- Triggers **retail-collapse** in sectors dependent on imported goods when disruption creates sustained shortages >60 days or price spikes >15%
- Amplifies **economic-recession** by 0.5-1.5 percentage points in GDP growth when manufacturing utilization drops >25% for sustained periods

## Warning Signs

**Early Indicators of Supply Chain Crisis Escalation:**

- **Single-Source Dependency + Geopolitical Tension** = Critical components (semiconductors, rare earths, pharma precursors) sourced from one region (Taiwan, China, Vietnam) while tensions escalate with that region's government. Risk of permanent supply disruption grows daily; within 30 days of escalation, companies begin emergency reshoring investments and inventory buildup, raising costs 5-12%.

- **Low Inventory Levels + Multiple Risk Factors** = Manufacturing utilization at 85%+ (common in JIT systems), inventory at 30-45 days supply (below 60-90 day safety threshold), while simultaneously facing port congestion, labor shortages, and geopolitical uncertainty. Single disruption would immediately halt production; 90+ day recovery window likely.

- **Port Congestion + Demand Growth** = Average container dwell time at major ports (LA, Shanghai, Rotterdam, Singapore) exceeds 7-10 days (normal is 3-4 days); simultaneously, demand growth is straining production capacity. Supply chain is operating at maximum stress; any disruption cascades immediately into consumer shortages within 60 days.

- **Tariff Escalation + Inventory Freeze** = New tariffs or trade barriers announced; companies immediately halt inventory building due to cost uncertainty. Within 45-60 days of tariff implementation, supply shock hits as companies realize barriers permanent; production cuts and price spikes follow.

- **Regional Conflict + Critical Supply Zone** = Military conflict, blockade, or sanctions targeting region with >20% global supply of critical input (semiconductors, shipping capacity, rare earths). Within 30-45 days, global supply of that input drops 20-40%, triggering cascading production cuts across dependent industries over next 60-90 days.

- **Logistics Cost Spike + Demand Destruction** = Fuel costs, shipping rates, or labor costs increase 15%+ sustainably (not temporary spike); demand for manufactured goods begins declining 10-20% as consumers shift behavior or purchasing power erodes. Combines with supply constraints to create "squeeze": margins compress, investment in resilience stalls, JIT dependencies deepen, setting up future crisis.

- **Three Concurrent Disruptions in 12 Months** = Supply chain experiences three separate disruptions (port strike, geopolitical crisis, natural disaster, etc.) within 12-month window. Signals structural fragility; companies shift from JIT to resilience mode, triggering sustained cost increases 5-15%, economic friction lasting 18-36 months, and potential reshoring/nearshoring cascades consuming 50-100 billion investment.
