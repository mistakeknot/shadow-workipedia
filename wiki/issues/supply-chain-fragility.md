# Supply Chain Fragility

## Overview

Modern supply chains have optimized for efficiency at the expense of resilience, creating single points of failure across critical industries. The shift toward just-in-time manufacturing, geographic concentration of production (especially semiconductors and rare earths), and geopolitical tensions have exposed vulnerabilities that can cascade into economic disruption. The tension between pursuing cost efficiency and maintaining strategic autonomy creates a fundamental instability in global trade networks.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Economic Resilience**: Decreases when supply disruptions occur; increases slowly through reshoring and redundancy investments (costly)
- **Manufacturing Capacity**: Decreases when production hubs are disrupted; increases through reshoring but at lower efficiency than centralized production
- **Consumer Prices**: Increases sharply during shortage crises; affected by transportation bottlenecks and strategic tariffs
- **Strategic Autonomy**: Increases when countries invest in domestic production; decreases when dependent on foreign suppliers
- **Trade Dependencies**: Represents fragility; high dependencies create vulnerability to blockades and coercion

**Event Types:**
1. **Critical Shortage Crisis**: Triggered by major production hub disruption (natural disaster, geopolitical action, or pandemic). Creates immediate price spikes and consumer rationing. Cascades across industries.
2. **Port/Canal Blockage**: Shipping routes disrupted (Suez, Panama, Strait of Malacca). Dramatically increases shipping times and costs. Threatens global trade flows.
3. **Chip Fab Disruption**: Semiconductor manufacturing facility taken offline. Creates cascading shortages in tech, automotive, and defense industries.
4. **Reshoring Initiative**: Countries invest in domestic manufacturing capacity for strategic goods. Increases local resilience but reduces global efficiency and raises consumer costs.
5. **Strategic Stockpile Depletion**: Emergency reserves of critical materials exhausted. Leaves economies vulnerable to future disruptions.

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Great Power Rivalry Redux** when supply chains become weaponized through sanctions or blockades
- Amplifies **Pandemic Response Wars** by creating scarcity-driven competition for medical supplies and vaccines
- Amplifies **Rare Earth Element Squeeze** as supply chain dependencies make rare earth monopolies more dangerous
- Can lead to **Infrastructure Decay** as countries cut maintenance budgets to fund reshoring investments
- Worsens **Economic Recession** when major disruptions create persistent inflation and unemployment

## Warning Signs

- High geographic concentration + Geopolitical tension = Blockade Risk
- Just-in-time inventory + Production hub instability = Shortage Crisis Risk
- Strategic material dependency + Export restrictions = Supply Weaponization Risk
- High trade interconnection + Tariff escalation = Trade War Amplification
- Delayed reshoring investment + New disruption event = Cascading Economic Shock
