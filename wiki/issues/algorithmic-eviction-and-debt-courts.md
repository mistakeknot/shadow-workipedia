# Algorithmic Eviction and Debt Courts

## Overview

Algorithmic systems have infiltrated housing courts and debt collection processes, automating the eviction pipeline and eroding due process protections. Landlords file thousands of evictions through software platforms that generate standardized complaints, while courts struggling with backlogs increasingly rely on algorithmic judges and automated bench trials. AI-powered tenant screening blacklists operate with minimal transparency, creating permanent housing barriers for those labeled as "high-risk." Debt collection algorithms pursue tenants across multiple jurisdictions simultaneously, compounding financial pressures. Legal aid systems, already severely underfunded, cannot keep pace with the volume of algorithmic filings. The result is a two-tiered system: resourced individuals can contest automated claims, while vulnerable populations face algorithmic eviction with no meaningful opportunity to respond.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Eviction Rates**: Algorithmic filing systems increase eviction velocity by 40-60%, overwhelming tenant capacity to mount defenses
- **Due Process**: Automated court procedures reduce average case resolution time from 90 days to 14 days, eliminating time for legal representation
- **Housing Stability**: Each eviction triggers long-term rental blacklisting, reducing housing access by 65% for 7+ years
- **Legal Aid Shortage**: Debt collection filings grow 3x faster than legal aid capacity, leaving 85% of tenants unrepresented

**Event Types:**
1. **Automated Eviction Surge**: Landlord platforms file bulk evictions when housing market conditions trigger; affects hundreds of tenants simultaneously
2. **Algorithmic Judge Trial**: Court deploys automated decision-making for routine eviction cases; reduces tenant win rates by 45%
3. **Blacklist Notification**: Tenant appears on AI screening platform after eviction; permanently damages rental prospects
4. **Debt Escalation**: Collection algorithm adds late fees, court costs, and interest; debt snowballs 2-3x original amount
5. **Legal Aid Crisis**: Too many filings, too few lawyers; public defender offices collapse under demand

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Housing Impossibility Crisis** when eviction rates exceed local vacancy rates
- Triggers **Homelessness Criminalization** when evicted populations are criminalized for street living
- Triggers **Algorithmic Discrimination** when AI screening systems correlate proxy variables (zip code, name, financial history) with protected characteristics

## Warning Signs

- **Eviction filing growth + Court automation adoption** = Due process erosion accelerates
- **Tenant representation deficit + Algorithmic judge deployment** = Win rate for tenants falls below 10%
- **Housing blacklist expansion + Economic recession** = Homelessness increases 200%+
- **Debt collection AI + Wage garnishment** = Wage floor disappears; debt traps entire families
