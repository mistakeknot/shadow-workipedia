# Algorithmic Collusion and Market Manipulation

## Overview

Algorithmic collusion describes the emergence of effective price-fixing, wage suppression, and market manipulation through AI systems that coordinate without explicit human conspiracy. Machine learning systems trained on similar data and optimizing similar objectives naturally converge on collusive equilibria.
Traditional antitrust frameworks require evidence of explicit agreement, leaving regulators powerless against algorithmic tacit coordination. The result is systematic extraction of consumer and worker surplus by increasingly correlated AI-driven market participants.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Pricing Algorithm Convergence**: Competing firms using similar AI pricing systems begin setting nearly identical prices without explicit coordination. Consumer advocates identify patterns suggesting tacit collusion.
- **Robo-Advisor Herding**: AI-driven investment systems trained on similar data begin making correlated decisions, amplifying market movements and creating flash crashes through synchronized panic selling.
- **Labor Market Algorithm Cartel**: Employers using AI wage-setting tools converge on suppressed wage levels. Workers face effective wage-fixing without any explicit employer conspiracy to prosecute.
- **Market Making AI Dominance**: A small number of AI systems come to dominate market-making across asset classes. Their correlated behavior creates new systemic risks as they simultaneously withdraw liquidity during stress.
- **Antitrust Framework Collapse**: Regulators acknowledge that existing antitrust law cannot address algorithmic collusion. Markets operate with effective price-fixing that no legal framework can remedy.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Price Convergence** → **Consumer Harm**: Algorithmic pricing eliminates competition without explicit cartel behavior. Consumers pay higher prices with no legal recourse.
- **Wage Suppression** → **Inequality Spike**: AI-coordinated wage-setting extracts surplus from workers to capital owners. The labor share of income declines faster than automation alone would cause.
- **Market Correlation** → **Systemic Risk**: Herding AI systems create new channels for contagion. A shock in one market triggers correlated responses across seemingly unrelated assets.
- **Regulatory Failure** → **Trust Collapse**: Public recognition that markets are rigged by algorithms undermines faith in capitalism and market-based resource allocation.

## Warning Signs

- Price correlation patterns emerging across nominally competing firms
- Flash crashes with synchronized algorithmic responses
- Wage growth persistently below productivity despite tight labor markets
- Antitrust cases failing due to lack of explicit coordination evidence
- Market liquidity evaporating simultaneously across venues
- Regulatory agencies acknowledging gaps in algorithmic oversight
- Whistleblowers revealing pricing algorithm design priorities
