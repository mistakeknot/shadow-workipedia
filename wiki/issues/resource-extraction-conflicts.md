# Resource Extraction Conflicts

## Overview

Resource extraction remains one of the most persistent sources of conflict globally, as the world's insatiable demand for minerals, metals, oil, and timber collides with local communities, indigenous populations, and environmental systems. From lithium mines in the Atacama Desert destabilizing water supplies for Andean communities, to coltan extraction funding armed groups in Central Africa, to deforestation in the Amazon displacing indigenous nations—extraction creates cascading crises that span decades. The fundamental tension is structural: resource-rich regions are often economically disadvantaged and politically marginalized, making them vulnerable to exploitation by multinational corporations backed by wealthy nations seeking raw materials for electronics, energy infrastructure, and manufacturing.

The violence of extraction extends beyond environmental destruction to direct human harm. Mining operations have sparked armed conflicts in multiple continents, killed indigenous leaders and environmental activists at alarming rates, and created intergenerational trauma in affected communities. Between 2015-2023, over 1,900 environmental defenders were murdered, with extractive industries responsible for a significant portion. Simultaneously, governments and corporations deploy security forces that blur the line between law enforcement and repression, while displacement without meaningful consent or compensation creates permanent social fracturing.

This crisis is accelerating as global energy transitions and technological advancement increase demand for new materials—cobalt, nickel, lithium, rare earth elements—without corresponding improvement in labor standards, indigenous rights protections, or environmental remediation. The structural incentive for governments and corporations to externalize extraction costs onto local populations and ecosystems, combined with weak international enforcement mechanisms and complicit supply chains, ensures that resource conflicts will remain a defining feature of global inequality.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

- **Corporate Governance Index** (0-100): Lower values enable extractive industries to operate with minimal accountability; each 10-point decrease increases likelihood of labor rights violations by 15% and community resistance events by 22%.
- **Indigenous Land Rights** (0-100): Values below 40 correlate with 3.2x higher rates of forced displacement and resource conflicts; strengthening this parameter reduces extraction approval probability by 35% in affected territories.
- **Environmental Enforcement** (0-100): Below 45, environmental impact assessments are routinely ignored or falsified; weak enforcement increases probability of ecological collapse events by 28% within 5 years of major extraction commencement.
- **Community Consultation** (0-100): Below 50, extraction projects proceed without meaningful indigenous consent; this drives resistance movements that escalate to armed conflict with 19% probability annually.
- **Extractive Industry Revenue Dependency** (0-100): Values above 65 create structural vulnerability where governments prioritize extraction over regulation; increases corruption by 24 points and reduces willingness to enforce environmental protections.

### Cascading Effects

- **Extraction triggering indigenous mobilization**: Resource project approval → indigenous rights reduction (15 points) → cultural identity threats → regional conflict escalation (+18% likelihood) → destabilization spreading to adjacent regions (contagion radius ~300km).
- **Environmental degradation creating climate vulnerability**: Large-scale extraction → environmental index decrease (25 points) → water/food scarcity → rural poverty increase (+30%) → climate refugee flows (+40,000-200,000 per major event).
- **Conflict minerals fueling regional wars**: Extraction in war zones → revenue to armed groups (+$50-300M annually) → military capability increase → conflict intensity escalation → humanitarian crisis deepening → IDP populations (+1M possible).
- **Economic dependency locking in extraction**: High revenue dependency (>70) → political capture of regulatory bodies → environmental/labor law weakening → race-to-the-bottom dynamics → neighboring countries reducing protections in competitive extraction.
- **Reputation cascades damaging multinational operations**: Activist assassination → international attention → consumer campaigns → corporate reputation loss → supply chain disruption → operational license at risk → stock price collapse (30-50% possible).

## Warning Signs

- **Accelerating land acquisitions without community consultation**: When governments or corporations rapidly consolidate territorial rights in resource-rich areas without transparent processes, conflict probability increases by 35% within 18 months.
- **Suppression of environmental impact assessments or community feedback**: Governments ignoring their own EIA requirements or preventing public comment periods indicates institutional capture and predicts resource conflict escalation within 12-24 months.
- **Spike in indigenous grievance indices or regional activist activity**: When indigenous organizations increase public statements or legal challenges by 200%+ and activist networks mobilize, armed resistance probability increases to 25-40% within 2 years.
- **Labor rights violations or worker fatalities in extraction operations**: Multiple reported deaths, wage theft, or unsafe conditions signal inadequate regulation; correlates with 45% increased likelihood of violent labor protests and international attention.
- **Deterioration of water quality or agricultural productivity near extraction sites**: Chemical contamination measurable in drinking water, crop failures in surrounding agricultural land, or livestock die-offs indicate environmental feedback loops that generate displacement urgency (5,000-15,000 people at immediate risk).
- **Political consolidation of extractive industry influence**: When corporate campaign contributions increase by 150%+, regulatory agency hiring of former industry executives accelerates, or governments reject environmental/labor amendments, systemic accountability collapse is imminent (institutional capture probability >75%).
