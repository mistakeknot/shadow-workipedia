# Democratic Backsliding

## Overview

Democratic backsliding represents the gradual erosion of democratic norms and institutions through ostensibly legal means—not violent coups, but slow-motion autocratization. Following the Hungary/Poland model, authoritarian-leaning governments pack constitutional courts, capture media outlets, and tilt electoral systems while maintaining democratic facades. Each norm violation enables the next as the authoritarian playbook unfolds: opposition faces prosecution, critical media shutters, and ruling parties refuse to leave power, dismantling democratic institutions through accumulated breaches that create cascading institutional capture and permanent minority rule.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Democratic Norms**: Base decay of -3 to -5 points per year when norm violations occur without consequences; accelerates to -8 to -12 points annually when institutional checks fail to respond. When Democratic Norms drop below 50, precedent-based acceleration increases all future violations by +2 severity. At <30, backsliding becomes nearly irreversible without external intervention.

- **Judicial Independence**: Initial court packing event causes -15 to -25 point decline as loyalists replace independent judges. Each subsequent loyalist appointment reduces independence by an additional -8 to -12 points. When Judicial Independence falls below 40, rulings favoring executive power increase by 65-80%. Below 25, courts rubber-stamp virtually all executive actions (95%+ approval rate), matching Hungary's Constitutional Court post-2010 capture.

- **Press Freedom**: State advertising weaponization triggers -10 to -15 point decline initially, followed by -5 to -8 points per year as outlets either comply or close. When Press Freedom Index drops below 45, critical media outlets begin mass closures (12-20% annually). Below 30, independent journalism effectively ceases (matching Russia's ~15 press freedom score), with 85-95% of major outlets government-aligned or self-censoring.

- **Electoral Integrity**: Gerrymandering legislation causes immediate -12 to -18 point drop; voter roll purges add -6 to -10 points per major purge event. Polling place closures in opposition areas reduce integrity by -4 to -7 points per election cycle. When Electoral Integrity falls below 55, opposition parties require 8-12% popular vote margins to win legislative majorities. Below 35, minority rule becomes structurally locked in (matching Wisconsin's ~3.5% Democratic vote advantage needed to break gerrymandered majority).

- **Institutional Trust**: Drops -20 to -30 points following high-visibility court capture or media suppression events. Each additional institutional capture adds -10 to -15 points. When Institutional Trust falls below 40, bureaucratic effectiveness declines by 25-40% due to talent flight and compliance issues. Below 25, governance legitimacy crisis triggers, with 60-75% of citizens viewing government as captured by authoritarian faction.

**Event Types:**

1. **Norm Violation Cascade** (Trigger: Executive power at 65+ with Judicial Independence <50)
   - High-ranking ally convicted of corruption receives immediate presidential pardon
   - Democratic Norms: -8 to -12 points as immunity precedent established
   - Rule of Law: -15 to -22 points as impunity spreads to lower officials
   - Outcome: 40-60% increase in executive branch ethics violations in following 2 years; mid-level officials cite precedent to justify own misconduct. Real-world parallel: Turkey post-2013 pardons enabling corruption cascade.

2. **Opposition Persecution** (Trigger: Judicial Independence <45, Democratic Norms <55)
   - Prosecutors file selective corruption charges against leading opposition figures
   - Democratic Norms: -10 to -15 points as prosecutorial weaponization normalized
   - Electoral Integrity: -8 to -12 points as opposition leadership faces disqualification
   - Outcome: 25-40% of opposition candidates face spurious investigations; election competitiveness drops by 15-25 percentage points. Mirrors Poland's judiciary targeting opposition mayors (2018-2020).

3. **Media Suppression** (Trigger: Press Freedom <50, Executive Power 60+)
   - Tax audits and regulatory harassment target outlets critical of government; state advertising redirected exclusively to friendly media
   - Press Freedom: -12 to -18 points as 15-25% of critical outlets close within 18 months
   - Institutional Trust: -10 to -15 points as citizens recognize transparent censorship
   - Outcome: Media ownership consolidates among government allies (65-80% market share); investigative journalism drops by 50-70%. Hungary's Orban achieved 80%+ pro-government media by 2018 using these exact tactics.

4. **Judicial Capture** (Trigger: Constitutional Court vacancy with Executive Power 70+)
   - Loyalist appointee confirmed despite opposition; immediately rules executive orders override legislative constraints
   - Judicial Independence: -18 to -25 points as court becomes executive rubber stamp
   - Democratic Norms: -12 to -18 points as checks and balances visibly collapse
   - Outcome: Executive wins 85-95% of constitutional challenges; separation of powers effectively ends. Venezuela's Supreme Court post-2004 packing resulted in 100% executive victory rate on major cases.

5. **Election Rigging** (Trigger: Electoral Integrity <60, Ruling Party controls redistricting)
   - Extreme gerrymandering passed; opposition districts require 65-75% vote shares to win seats while ruling party wins seats with 45-50%
   - Electoral Integrity: -15 to -20 points as structural bias locks in minority rule
   - Democratic Norms: -10 to -15 points as electoral fairness abandoned
   - Outcome: Ruling party secures legislative supermajority despite losing popular vote by 3-7 points; opposition paths to power via elections effectively closed. North Carolina's 2016 gerrymander achieved 10-3 Republican advantage despite near-50/50 vote split.

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Election Denialism** (+40% likelihood) when authoritarian parties normalize refusing to accept electoral defeats, citing fabricated fraud claims. Denial becomes reflexive when Electoral Integrity <45.
- Amplifies **Gerrymandering Extremism** (+35% severity) by enabling safe districts where authoritarian candidates face no accountability from moderate voters; extremism index increases 25-40% in gerrymandered districts.
- Can lead to **Billionaire Media Ownership** (+50% risk when Press Freedom <40) as oligarchs aligned with autocrats buy independent outlets to neutralize criticism; 60-80% of major media becomes oligarch-controlled within 3-5 years.
- Creates pressure for **Electoral College Crisis** (+30% likelihood when Electoral Integrity <50) as minority rule becomes structurally entrenched through systems that amplify authoritarian voting blocs.

## Warning Signs

- **Accountability Collapse** (Critical Risk when Democratic Norms <55 + Judicial Independence <45): Norm violations go unpunished as captured courts refuse to check executive power; corruption increases 40-60% within 2 years as officials recognize impunity. Point of no return typically occurs when both parameters fall below 40 simultaneously.

- **Information-Free Elections** (High Risk when Press Freedom <40 + Electoral Integrity <50): Voters lack access to critical information about candidates/policies as independent media shutters and election systems favor ruling party; informed consent becomes impossible. Election competitiveness drops by 30-50% as information asymmetry compounds structural advantages.

- **One-Party Entrenchment** (Critical Risk when Electoral Integrity <45 + Gerrymandering Index >65): Opposition cannot win elections even with popular vote majorities; democratic alternation of power ends. Historical data shows <5% chance of peaceful power transfer once both thresholds crossed without external intervention.

- **Authoritarian Legitimation** (System Failure when Democratic Norms <35 + Institutional Trust <30): Citizens accept authoritarian rule as legitimate or inevitable; democratic culture collapses. Resistance movements emerge but face 70-85% suppression rate; restoration requires average 12-18 years and typically external shock (economic crisis, military defeat, or international pressure).
