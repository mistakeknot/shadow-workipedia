# Democratic Backsliding

## Overview

Democratic backsliding represents the gradual erosion of democratic norms and institutions through ostensibly legal means—not violent coups, but slow-motion autocratization. Following the Hungary/Poland model, authoritarian-leaning governments pack constitutional courts, capture media outlets, and tilt electoral systems while maintaining democratic facades. Each norm violation enables the next as the authoritarian playbook unfolds: opposition faces prosecution, critical media shutters, and ruling parties refuse to leave power, dismantling democratic institutions through accumulated breaches that create cascading institutional capture and permanent minority rule.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Democratic Norms**: Erodes steadily as each violation creates precedent for the next, accelerating when institutions fail to impose consequences
- **Judicial Independence**: Declines sharply when courts are packed with loyalists who rule in favor of executive power over constitutional limits
- **Press Freedom**: Collapses as state advertising is weaponized, licenses threatened, and critical outlets face selective prosecution under anti-defamation laws
- **Electoral Integrity**: Degrades through legal manipulation—gerrymandering, voter ID laws, polling place closures in opposition areas, and election official purges
- **Institutional Trust**: Plummets as citizens witness transparent institutional capture, creating legitimacy crisis that destabilizes even basic governance

**Event Types:**
1. **Norm Violation Cascade**: Presidential pardon of convicted allies establishes immunity precedent, emboldening further lawbreaking at all levels
2. **Opposition Persecution**: Prosecutors file corruption charges against opposition leaders using laws selectively enforced only against government critics
3. **Media Suppression**: Tax audits target critical newspapers while state advertising flows exclusively to pro-government outlets, forcing closures
4. **Judicial Capture**: Constitutional court vacancy filled with loyalist who consistently rules that executive power overrides legislative or judicial checks
5. **Election Rigging**: Ruling party gerrymanders districts, purges voter rolls in opposition strongholds, and appoints partisan election officials who reject ballots on technicalities

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Election Denialism** when authoritarian parties normalize refusing to accept electoral defeats, claiming fraud when they lose
- Amplifies **Gerrymandering Extremism** by enabling safe districts where authoritarian candidates face no accountability from moderate voters
- Can lead to **Billionaire Media Ownership** in circumstances where oligarchs aligned with autocrats buy independent outlets to neutralize criticism
- Creates pressure for **Electoral College Crisis** as minority rule becomes structurally entrenched through systems that amplify authoritarian voting blocs

## Warning Signs

- Norm Violation Without Consequences + Judicial Capture = Accountability Collapse
- Media Suppression + Electoral Manipulation = Information-Free Elections
- Opposition Persecution + Gerrymandered Safe Districts = One-Party Entrenchment
- Democratic Norms Erosion + Institutional Trust Collapse = Authoritarian Legitimation
