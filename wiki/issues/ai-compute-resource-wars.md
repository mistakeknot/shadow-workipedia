# AI Compute Resource Wars

## Overview

The AI Compute Resource Wars represent a strategic bottleneck defining technological supremacy in the 21st century. As AI capabilities scale exponentially, demand for specialized compute hardware (GPUs, TPUs, AI chips) has dramatically outpaced supply, creating cascading geopolitical, economic, and environmental crises.

Three converging pressures drive the crisis: **Hardware concentration** (NVIDIA controls 88-92% of AI accelerator market), **supply chain fragility** (Taiwan's TSMC manufactures 92% of cutting-edge chips), and **resource intensity** (training GPT-4-equivalent models requires 10,000-50,000 GPUs consuming 10-15 megawatts for 2-4 months).

These constraints create ruthless competition where only well-capitalized actors can afford $5-20B AI lab buildouts, concentrating power and creating vulnerability to supply shocks and geopolitical coercion.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameters:**

- **Compute Availability Index** (0-100): GPU supply vs demand. At 100, supply matches demand at market price (~$15K-25K per H100). Below 50, severe scarcity drives 2-3x price inflation. Below 30, rationing by geopolitical alignment. Each 10-point drop below 70 reduces global AI research diversity by ~8%.

- **GPU Pricing Volatility** (-100 to +100): Price stability. Above 50, planning becomes impossible. Positive volatility indicates scarcity-driven spikes; negative indicates deflation enabling broader access. $500B annual GDP loss per +20 points through delayed projects.

- **NVIDIA Monopoly Strength** (0-100): Market dominance. At 90+ (current), NVIDIA can raise prices 15-30% unilaterally. Reducing from 90 to 60 increases Compute Availability +15-20, drops Pricing Volatility by 30.

- **Manufacturing Capacity** (0-100): Global fab capacity for AI accelerators. Currently ~35-40. At 50, demand met without scarcity premiums. Increases through fab expansions ($5-10B, 2-3 years) or chiplet technology.

- **Data Center Energy Grid Capacity** (0-100): Available power in tech hubs. Below 40, chronic rationing forces relocations. Each 10-point drop below 70 adds $50M-200M annual costs per major lab.

- **Geopolitical Supply Chain Risk** (0-100): Disruption probability from Taiwan conflict, trade wars, sanctions. At 50, moderate delays (2-4 weeks). At 75+, 3-6 month interruptions drive hoarding. Taiwan conflict at 70+ triggers 6-12 month compute freeze, 18-36 month setback, $2-5T losses.

**Events:**

1. **Manufacturing Breakthrough**: New fab or competitor achieves cost-parity. Manufacturing Capacity +15-25, NVIDIA Monopoly -15 to -30, Pricing Volatility -20 to -40.

2. **GPU Price Spike**: Taiwan tensions, export restrictions, or fab accident. Pricing Volatility +30 to +50, Compute Availability -20 to -35. Startups priced out; dominant players consolidate.

3. **Energy Grid Crisis**: Tech hub power grid maxed out. Data Center Energy Capacity -25 to -40 in region, forces 20-40% buildout migration.

4. **Taiwan Conflict/Trade War**: Geopolitical crisis threatens TSMC. Supply Chain Risk +40 to +60. Above 70 triggers hoarding (6-12 month inventory orders), price speculation (3-5x normal), 18-36 month AI setback.

5. **Custom Silicon Success**: Cloud provider deploys alternatives (TPUs, Trainium). NVIDIA Monopoly -20 to -40, Compute Availability +10 to +25, but fragments ecosystem compatibility.

6. **Efficiency Breakthrough**: Algorithmic advances reduce compute needs 30-50%. Compute Availability +20 to +40, Pricing Volatility halved. Examples: transformers (2017), flash attention (2022-2023).

**Cascade Triggers:**

- **Semiconductor Sovereignty Wars**: Supply Chain Risk >60 AND Manufacturing Capacity <50
- **AI Alignment Crisis**: +30-50% (GPU scarcity forces inadequately-tested deployments)
- **State-Sponsored Hacking Epidemic**: +40-60% (GPU theft profitable at $200K-2M per unit)
- **Civil Society Participation**: -25-40% (only mega-corporations can afford compute)
- **Global Energy Crisis**: +20-35% (AI consumes 15-20% of tech hub electricity by 2028)
- **International Crisis**: Taiwan conflict + Supply Chain Risk >75 + Compute Availability <30 = 12-24 month AI freeze

## Warning Signs

**Early Stage (1900-1950):**
- GPU prices rising 15-25% annually with persistent shortages
- NVIDIA profit margins 60-70% (monopoly signal)
- Smaller labs closing; startup funding concentrating in mega-corps
- Taiwan geopolitical tension; export control discussions
- Manufacturing announcements exceeding actual construction

**Mid-Stage (1950-1990):**
- Spot prices 2-3x nominal ($50K-75K per unit)
- Hoarding behavior (2-3 year advance orders)
- AMD/Intel competitive products delayed/failing
- Data center power approaching grid limits
- Supply Chain Risk >50; trade war rhetoric
- Used/older GPUs primary sourcing for 30-40% of labs

**Critical (1990-2050):**
- Taiwan conflict risk >60
- Compute Availability <50; boom-bust pricing cycles
- Custom silicon fragmenting market (interoperability crisis)
- Major labs forced to relocate (energy/geopolitical constraints)
- NVIDIA monopoly + geopolitical risk = single company controls global AI

**Point of No Return (2050+):**
- Taiwan conflict reduces TSMC output 30-50% for 6+ months
- Compute Availability <30; rationing replaces markets
- 12-24 month AI development halt; 18-36 month capability gaps
- Multi-region energy crises force data center closures
- Compute access weaponized as geopolitical lever

## Key Vulnerabilities

**Market Concentration:**
- NVIDIA: 88-92% AI accelerator market share
- TSMC: 92% of advanced (5nm-7nm) chip production
- H100 production cost ~$5K-7K; scarcity price $25K-40K (6-8x markup)
- Annual monopoly rent: $50-100B (0.05-0.1% of global GDP)

**Supply Chain Chokepoints:**
- Taiwan conflict could cut global supply 80-90% for 6-18 months
- High-bandwidth memory: 95% from Micron, SK Hynix, Samsung
- Packaging/substrate: Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia (any disruption = -20-40% GPU production)

**Energy Constraints:**
- Northern Virginia: 35% of US AI compute, grid at 80% capacity by 2027
- California: Grid instability 2025-2028 from competing demand
- Ireland: Data centers consume 30% of national electricity
- AI data centers: 400-600 TWh annually (2024) → 2,000-3,000 TWh by 2030 (4-6% global electricity)

**Geopolitical Positions:**
- **US**: Controls NVIDIA/CUDA but dependent on Taiwan; investing $50B+ in domestic fabs
- **China**: Barred from advanced GPUs, 18-24 months behind in AI capability
- **EU**: Zero domestic capacity; €43B Chips Act, fabs operational 2027-2030
- **Emerging Markets**: Locked out by cost/restrictions; 50-100 year capability gap
