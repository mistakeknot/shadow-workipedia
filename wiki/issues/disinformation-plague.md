# Disinformation Plague

## Overview

Coordinated spread of false information creates epistemological crisis where competing narratives cannot be adjudicated through shared evidence. State actors ($1M-$100M budgets), partisan media, profit-seekers, and AI-generated content fragment society into reality tunnels that interpret identical events through incommensurate frameworks. First Amendment prohibits government content regulation while Section 230 shields platforms from liability, creating legal environment where viral lies spread faster than truth can correct them.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Media Trust**: Falls 1.5%/year baseline (72% 1950 → 32% 2024). Drops 5-8% on deepfake scandal, fact-checker assassination. Recovery requires 20-30 years generational replacement once <20% threshold crossed.
- **Partisan Gap**: Widens from 56% (2024) to 70%+ (2040). Each culture war battle amplified by disinformation adds 2-5% gap. Identity-protective cognition causes 10-25% backfire effect when corrected.
- **Reality Exile Population**: Grows 5% (2016) → 12-15% (2024) → 25-30% (2040). Alt-tech adoption (Telegram 50-100M US users, Rumble 50M) creates parallel information ecosystem with zero cross-cutting exposure.
- **Election Acceptance**: Declines 85% (2000) → 60% (2020) → 35-40% (2040). Below 40% triggers dual government constitutional crisis, political violence escalates to 100+ incidents/year.
- **Journalism Capacity**: Newspaper revenue $46B (2005) → $6B (2022) → $500M (2040). Investigative capacity 100% → 20% → 5%, local news deserts 500 → 1800 → 2500 counties (80% coverage).

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Deepfake Reality Crisis** when AI quality crosses 0.90 threshold (visual/audio indistinguishable). Perfect deepfakes eliminate all visual evidence as truth anchor, accelerate epistemic collapse.
- Amplifies **Social Media Addiction** via engagement optimization (outrage maximization 2-6× spread, infinite scroll, recommendation rabbit holes). Addictive design increases disinformation exposure hours/day.
- Can lead to **Pandemic Response Wars** via health misinformation (vaccine hesitancy 67% → 50% intent = 300k excess deaths). Public health crises create disinformation opportunities when fear + uncertainty peak.
- Creates pressure for **Election Denialism** when acceptance <50% + institutional legitimacy <50% = 0.80 constitutional crisis probability. Dual governments, political violence, international legitimacy collapse.

## Warning Signs

- Media Trust <30% + Reality Exile >15% = Irreversible epistemic fragmentation (recovery requires generational replacement 20-30 years)
- AI Content Quality >0.90 + Detection Lag >12 months = Deepfake scandal imminent (fake candidate videos, election interference)
- Partisan Gap >60% + Cross-Cutting Exposure <5% = Democratic deliberation impossible (parallel reality tunnels cannot agree on shared facts)
- Election Acceptance <50% + Political Violence >50 incidents/year = Constitutional crisis (dual governments, civil war risk)
