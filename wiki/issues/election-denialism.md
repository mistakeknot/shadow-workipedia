# Election Denialism

## Overview

Election denialism represents a fundamental erosion of democratic legitimacy through widespread rejection of election results and systematic distrust of electoral institutions. The movement gained particular prominence during and after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, crystallized around the "Stop the Steal" narrative, and continues to shape political outcomes and democratic stability.

The core mechanism operates through a feedback loop: election denialism delegitimizes electoral outcomes regardless of their validity, which undermines public confidence in democratic institutions, which then enables further anti-democratic measures (voting restrictions, institutional capture, violence), which in turn can generate real administrative failures through sabotage and incompetence, which then "validates" the original false claims. Despite repeated court losses and post-election reviews, distrust can persist for years and become a durable vulnerability in democratic resilience.

The tangible harms are substantial. The January 6, 2021 Capitol attack injured law enforcement officers and triggered a large federal prosecution effort; Reuters later reported that nearly 1,600 rioters had been prosecuted, and that President Donald Trump issued pardons after returning to the presidency.[^reuters_jan6_prosecutions_pardons][^ap_trump_pardons_2025] More systemically, threats and harassment targeting election administrators and workers increased materially after 2020, contributing to resignations and recruitment challenges.[^brennan_2024_election_officials]

Institutionally, election denialism can infect governance through staff selection effects (replacing experienced administrators with ideologically aligned but less competent successors), through politicized audits that consume scarce administrative capacity, and through legislative pressure on election administration. This represents a cascading failure mode: if election-denialist operatives capture election administration positions, they can introduce actual vulnerabilities (poor security, deleted records, incompetent audits) that then generate real irregularities, which become ammunition for the next cycle of denialism.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Democratic Trust Index**: In this model, election denialism reduces confidence in democratic institutions (and confidence in election administrators in particular). The decline is sticky: even after audits find no fraud, belief in fraud can persist if the audit process itself is framed as "rigged."

- **Political Polarization**: In this model, election denial drives sharp increases in partisan divergence on institutional trust and democracy questions, reducing cross-partisan cooperation on local governance.

- **Election Administration Capacity**: In this model, sustained denialism increases pressure on election offices, drives staff turnover, and diverts resources into politicized investigations and legal conflict rather than resilience work (cybersecurity, staffing, procedures, disaster recovery). Surveys indicate a materially elevated threat/harassment environment for local election officials.[^brennan_2024_election_officials]

- **Political Violence Amplitude**: In this model, election denial narratives increase threats, intimidation, and the probability of political violence targeting election workers and other perceived institutional opponents.[^brennan_2024_election_officials]

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **democratic-backsliding** when election denial belief exceeds 35% AND election-denialist operatives control state election administration + legislature
- Amplifies **disinformation-plague** by 25-35% through reinforcement loops: denial narratives spread via social media, spread increases believer numbers, increased believer numbers "validate" narratives, validation increases further spread
- Amplifies **political-violence** by 40-60% when denial narratives specifically name targets (election officials, governors who certified results) and call for action
- Triggers **voter-suppression** through downstream effect: denial narratives empower restrictive voting policies that are justified as "election security" responses to fraud claims
- Amplifies **institutional-capture** by enabling judges/legislators sympathetic to denial to make structural changes to electoral systems
- Can trigger **constitutional-crisis** if multiple swing states simultaneously attempt electors manipulation or refuse to recognize federal election results

## Warning Signs

**Early Indicators of Denialism Escalation:**

- **Denial Belief Exceeds 40% + Legislative Control** = Political party controlling legislature believes election fraud claims; passes legislation restricting ballot access, enabling partisan election boards, or hand-picking electors. Institutional vulnerabilities created, next election result will be contested regardless of actual outcome. Constitutional crisis probability: 60-75%.

- **Election Official Resignation Wave + Court Capture** = >15% annual turnover of non-partisan election officials + courts reverse election administration decisions in favor of restrictive policies. Successor officials lack security expertise, electoral system degrades within 12 months, actual vulnerabilities emerge.

- **Social Media Amplification + Fox News Integration** = False election fraud claims reach 40+ million people within 72 hours and are legitimized by cable news coverage that repeats narrative even while fact-checking it. Belief increases 18-22 percentage points nationally; effect lasts 6+ months.

- **Armed Group Involvement + Rhetoric Escalation** = Explicit calls for "election defense" by armed groups + state-level political figures amplify their involvement. Surveillance of election facilities increases, voter intimidation begins, election administration becomes physically unsafe.

- **Interstate Litigation Storm + Vote Counting Delays** = Multiple states file suits challenging other states' election procedures; delays in vote counting trigger immediate fraud allegations; delays compound through media coverage and social media. Every 1-hour delay in vote counting increases fraud belief by 2-3 percentage points; election results delegitimized even before finalization.

- **Institutional Incentive Realignment + Staff Selection** = State party apparatus begins primary-ing out election administrators who certified "unfavorable" results; next generation of administrators are selected for ideological loyalty over competence. This creates 12-24 month lag before consequences visible, but leads to systematic election administration degradation.

- **Denial Belief Stickiness + Audit Paradox** = After 18+ months, belief in election fraud remains 32-38% even though audits found no fraud; public now distrusts audits themselves as "rigged." No messaging strategy successfully reduces belief below this floor; institutional legitimacy now permanently damaged.
