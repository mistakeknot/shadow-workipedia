# Freshwater Crisis

## Overview

The global freshwater crisis represents an accelerating depletion of the world's finite water resources driven by aquifer overextraction, glacial melt, agricultural demand, and urban growth. Competition for dwindling supplies intensifies geopolitical tensions and threatens food security, public health, and human settlement patterns across multiple continents.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Water Availability**: Decreases steadily through aquifer depletion and glacial melt; accelerates during droughts and agricultural expansion
- **Agricultural Viability**: Directly constrained by water access; irrigation-dependent regions face productivity collapse when water stress exceeds adaptation capacity
- **Urban Sustainability**: Growing cities demand more freshwater; pressure increases with population growth and climate warming
- **Conflict Risk**: Intensifies when water scarcity crosses critical thresholds, especially in shared river basins and aquifer systems
- **Ecosystem Health**: Degrades as freshwater systems are diverted from natural uses; species extinction accelerates in water-dependent biomes
- **Economic Output**: Regional economies dependent on irrigated agriculture experience cascading losses as water becomes limiting factor

**Event Types:**

1. **Aquifer Collapse**: A major aquifer system becomes economically unviable to pump. Triggers agricultural crisis in dependent regions and mass displacement of rural populations.

2. **Water Rationing Declaration**: National or regional government implements mandatory water rationing. Reduces consumption by 20-40% but creates social unrest and informal black markets.

3. **Interstate Water War**: Two or more nations engage in militarized conflict over shared water resources (river basin, aquifer system). Creates humanitarian crisis and destabilizes entire regions.

4. **Desalination Breakthrough**: Technological advance makes large-scale desalination economically viable. Temporarily alleviates coastal water stress but increases energy demand and salt pollution.

5. **Water Rights Ruling**: International court or treaty establishes binding water allocation rules. Redistributes rights but may disadvantage downstream nations or marginalized populations.

6. **Glacier Melt Acceleration**: Accelerated glacial loss in mountain ranges reduces seasonal water supply. Cascades into agricultural failure in dependent lowlands within 2-3 years.

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Food System Fragility** when agricultural water stress exceeds 70% capacity
- Triggers **Climate Refugee Floods** when combined with drought-driven agricultural collapse
- Triggers **Infrastructure Decay** when water rationing reduces maintenance of irrigation systems
- Triggers **Water Scarcity Wars** when transboundary water disputes militarize
- Worsens **Population Displacement** through rural-to-urban migration and international climate migration

## Warning Signs

- **Aquifer depletion rate > groundwater recharge rate** + **Population growth in arid regions** = Imminent aquifer collapse in 10-20 years
- **Glacial retreat > 5% per decade** + **Heavy agricultural dependence on glacial melt** = Seasonal water shortage cascade
- **Shared river basin allocation disputes** + **Upstream dam construction** = Escalating interstate water tensions
- **Urban water demand growth > supply growth** + **Drought frequency increasing** = Urban water crisis within 5-10 years
- **Irrigation-dependent agriculture > 70% of regional water use** + **Aquifer depletion accelerating** = Agricultural collapse imminent
- **Cross-border aquifer systems** + **No international water treaty** + **Climate drying trend** = High conflict probability
