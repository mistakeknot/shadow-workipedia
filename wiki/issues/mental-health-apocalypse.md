# Mental Health Apocalypse

## Overview

Depression surges past 30% and suicide rates double, overwhelming a psychiatric care system already crippled by provider shortages and insurance network inadequacy. The 8-year clinician training pipeline cannot scale fast enough, while economic precarity, social media addiction, and AI job displacement compound demand. Untreated mental illness cascades into workforce collapse, opioid self-medication, and social cohesion breakdown.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Healthcare.PsychiatricBeds**: Falls from 550/100k (1950s) to 11/100k (2023). Below 8/100k triggers care system collapse.
- **Population.DepressionRate**: Baseline 8% doubles to 18-20% under stress (job loss, climate anxiety, social isolation). Above 30% triggers crisis threshold.
- **Economy.WorkforceBurnout**: Healthcare 62%, Education 58%, Retail 55-60%. Above 70% in 3+ essential sectors = cascading societal collapse.
- **Population.SuicideRate**: Baseline 14.2/100k. Media contagion events (celebrity suicide, viral content) spike rates +10-29%. Doubling triggers crisis.
- **Culture.SocialIsolation**: Serious loneliness rises from baseline to 36%. Close friends drop from 3.0 to 1.5. Above 40% = social cohesion breakdown.

**Event Types:**
1. **Therapist Shortage Riot**: Depression >30% + psychiatric bed capacity <10/100k = desperate patients overwhelm care facilities. Insurance narrow networks create de facto denial despite Mental Health Parity Act.
2. **Suicide Contagion Wave**: Celebrity/influencer suicide triggers +10-29% spike in same demographic. Social media amplifies Werther effect 3-5x over traditional media.
3. **Labor Force Burnout Spiral**: Sector burnout >70% → attrition → staff shortage → higher workload → more burnout (doom loop amplification >1.30x). Teachers, nurses, retail workers exit en masse.
4. **Disability Claims Surge**: Mental health becomes #1 cause (>35% of claims). SSDI backlog exceeds 18 months. Workers exit labor force permanently, triggering productivity collapse.
5. **Black Market Pharma**: Treatment access barriers drive underground SSRI distribution. "Happy Drug Cartel" supplies psychiatric meds without prescriptions as prescriber deserts leave 60% of counties with zero psychiatrists.

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Opioid Settlement Fallout** when untreated mental illness drives self-medication. 100k opioid deaths/year, 178k alcohol deaths as substance use becomes primary coping mechanism.
- Amplifies **AI Job Displacement** by destroying worker mental health during unemployment. Loss of purpose + economic precarity = depression spiral, reducing workforce reintegration capacity.
- Can lead to **Long COVID Labor Collapse** when mental health system cannot absorb disability surge. SSDI system overwhelmed by psychiatric + physical disability claims.
- Creates pressure for **Healthcare System Collapse** as psychiatric ER boarding (24-120 hours) clogs emergency departments. 60-70% treatment gap means crises escalate to acute care.

## Warning Signs

- Depression >25% + Psychiatric Beds <12/100k = Provider crisis imminent
- Burnout >60% in 2+ essential sectors + Quit Rate Rising = Labor force exodus accelerating
- Suicide Rate +15% + Social Media Contagion Event = Epidemic cascade risk
- Loneliness >35% + Social Capital Declining = Community support network failure
