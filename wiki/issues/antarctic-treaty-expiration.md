# Antarctic Treaty Expiration Crisis

## Overview

Antarctic treaty expiration crisis describes the approach of the treaty’s review window, when the Protocol on Environmental Protection becomes open for modification. The treaty system that has preserved Antarctica as a demilitarized scientific reserve for decades faces challenges from resource-hungry nations and changing geopolitical alignments.

Multiple nations hold territorial claims frozen by the treaty. As climate change makes Antarctic operations more feasible and global resource competition intensifies, pressure grows to abandon protection in favor of extraction. The continent’s resources and strategic positioning could trigger a destabilizing rush that undermines environmental protections and increases great-power friction.
