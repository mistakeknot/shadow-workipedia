# Nuclear Escalation Spiral

## Overview

Nuclear escalation spiral describes the dynamics by which conventional conflicts or crises between nuclear-armed states can escalate to nuclear weapons use. The risks include accidental launches from false alarms, deliberate tactical use that crosses the nuclear threshold, and spiraling retaliation that culminates in strategic exchange.
Nine states possess nuclear weapons, with several regional flashpoints creating ongoing escalation risk. The erosion of arms control regimes, development of tactical nuclear options, and integration of cyber and space capabilities into nuclear command structures create new pathways to catastrophic miscalculation.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Tactical Nuclear Threshold Crossed**: A regional conflict sees first use of a low-yield tactical nuclear weapon against military targets. The nuclear taboo shatters as the world waits to see if retaliation follows.
- **Accidental Launch False Alarm**: Early warning systems generate a false positive indicating incoming missiles. Decision-makers have minutes to determine authenticity before launch-on-warning protocols activate.
- **Command Control Decapitation Attempt**: Cyberattacks or conventional strikes target nuclear command and control infrastructure, creating use-it-or-lose-it pressure on arsenal commanders.
- **Regional Nuclear Exchange**: Limited nuclear strikes between regional powers devastate population centers. Fallout crosses borders, drawing in alliance commitments and escalation pressure.
- **Strategic Exchange Initiation**: Great power nuclear exchange begins with counterforce strikes against missile silos and submarine bases. Civilization-ending scenarios unfold within hours.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Tactical Use** → **Taboo Collapse**: First use of nuclear weapons since 1945 fundamentally changes global security calculations. Proliferation incentives spike as non-nuclear states rush to acquire deterrent capability.
- **Regional Exchange** → **Global Fallout**: Even limited nuclear war produces radioactive fallout affecting agriculture, water supplies, and health across continents. Crop failures and cancer clusters persist for decades.
- **Strategic Exchange** → **Nuclear Winter**: Large-scale use of nuclear arsenals injects soot into stratosphere, reducing global temperatures and agricultural output for years. Billions face starvation even in non-combatant nations.
- **Command Disruption** → **Launch Automation**: Attacks on command infrastructure may trigger automated or delegated launch authorities, removing human judgment from escalation decisions at the most critical moments.

## Warning Signs

- Nuclear-armed states placing forces on heightened alert during crises
- Dual-use conventional strikes near nuclear facilities or command centers
- Breakdown of arms control treaties and verification regimes
- Development and deployment of low-yield tactical nuclear options
- Rhetoric normalizing nuclear use as battlefield weapons
- Cyberattacks targeting early warning or command systems
- Regional conflicts involving nuclear-armed adversaries intensifying
- Collapse of diplomatic back-channels between nuclear powers
