# Ocean Acidification Crisis

## Overview

Ocean acidification—the ongoing decrease in ocean pH caused by absorption of atmospheric CO2—threatens the foundation of marine food webs and coastal economies. As oceans become 30% more acidic than pre-industrial levels, shell-forming organisms weaken, coral reefs bleach and die, and entire fishing communities face economic collapse. This process is largely irreversible on human timescales.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Ocean pH Levels**: Decreases continuously as atmospheric CO2 rises; once pH drops below critical thresholds (7.8, 7.5), triggers cascading marine ecosystem failures
- **Marine Ecosystem Health**: Declines with acidification; accelerates when Coral Reef Coverage drops below 30% or Shellfish Industry Viability falls below 20%
- **Shellfish Industry Viability**: Collapses when ocean pH falls below 7.7; reduced viability triggers fishing community displacement and food security crises
- **Coral Reef Coverage**: Erodes with rising ocean temperatures and acidification; each 0.1 pH drop reduces coverage by 5-8%; complete collapse (0% coverage) is irreversible
- **Carbon Sink Capacity**: Declines as ocean pH acidifies; reduced capacity accelerates atmospheric CO2 accumulation, creating positive feedback loops

**Event Types:**
1. **Coral Bleaching Mass Event**: Occurs when ocean temperature anomaly exceeds +1.5°C and pH < 7.8. Kills 40-60% of remaining coral in affected regions; triggers ecosystem cascade.
2. **Shellfish Harvest Collapse**: Triggered when Shellfish Industry Viability drops below 20%. Regional fishing economies contract by 30-50%; displaces 10,000+ workers.
3. **Ocean pH Threshold Breach**: Occurs when pH crosses 7.8, 7.5, or 7.0. Each breach triggers automatic ecosystem damage and fishing industry penalties. Breach at 7.0 is catastrophic (irreversible).
4. **Blue Carbon Initiative**: Policy response event (conditional on Economic Power + Environmental Concern > 60). Partially restores carbon sink capacity if enacted within 5-10 years.
5. **Fishing Community Displacement**: Occurs when Shellfish Industry Viability < 10%. Displaced workers migrate to coastal cities, triggering urban overcrowding and climate-refugee pathways.

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Biodiversity Collapse** when Marine Ecosystem Health falls below 25%
- Triggers **Food System Fragility** when Shellfish Industry Viability < 15%
- Triggers **Climate-Refugee Floods** when 50,000+ coastal workers are displaced
- Synergizes with **Plastic Ocean Apocalypse**: combination accelerates species extinction and reduces fish stock recovery potential

## Warning Signs

- **Ocean pH + Rising Atmospheric CO2 = Acidification Spiral**: Each year without CO2 emissions reduction locks in further acidification; pH change lags CO2 by 5-10 years.
- **Coral Bleaching Events + Marine Heatwaves = Reef Collapse**: Rapid succession of bleaching events (2+ events within 10 years) causes permanent reef death; recovery becomes impossible.
- **Shellfish Decline + Coastal Poverty = Community Collapse**: When fishing communities lose > 50% of income and lack economic alternatives, displacement accelerates and social stability declines.
- **pH Below 7.8 + Pteropod Extinction = Food Web Collapse**: Pteropods (sea butterflies) are foundational food source; their extinction cascades to fish stocks and seabirds.
- **Acidification + Upwelling Zones = Regional Crisis**: Upwelling of already-acidic deep water amplifies local pH drops, creating "acidification dead zones" where larvae cannot develop.
