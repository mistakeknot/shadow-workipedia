# Deepfake Reality Crisis

## Overview

Generative adversarial networks achieve photorealistic synthesis at near-zero marginal cost, making forgery trivial while authentication becomes computationally expensive. This asymmetry creates "the liar's dividend"—all visual evidence becomes suspect, legal systems lack standards for detecting AI-generated content, and defenders bear exponentially higher verification costs than fabricators.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Media Trust**: Decreases sharply as authentic footage becomes indistinguishable from fabricated content
- **Political Stability**: Drops when fake speeches/scandals trigger crises (coup attempts, diplomatic incidents)
- **Legal System Integrity**: Degrades as courts struggle with chain-of-custody for digital exhibits without authentication standards
- **Economic Security**: Decreases from voice-clone fraud, CEO impersonation, stock manipulation via fake announcements
- **Social Cohesion**: Erodes as revenge porn, personal impersonation attacks, and identity fraud become trivial

**Event Types:**
1. **False Flag Operation**: Deepfake video of leader declaring war/confessing crimes triggers international crisis
2. **Evidence Nihilism Crisis**: Major trial collapses when defense proves surveillance footage could be AI-generated
3. **Revenge Porn Epidemic**: Mass victimization via synthetic intimate content destroys lives, legal system overwhelmed
4. **CEO Fraud Wave**: Voice-cloned executives authorize fraudulent transfers, corporate governance crisis
5. **Historical Revisionism**: Fabricated archival footage rewrites past events, collective memory becomes contested

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Disinformation Plague** by eliminating visual evidence as truth anchor—if nothing can be verified, all narratives compete equally
- Amplifies **AI-Deepfake Diplomatic Mutinies** by providing perfect tools for false flag operations between nations
- Can lead to **AI Voice Clone Fraud Meltdowns** as audio synthesis combines with video to enable total identity theft
- Creates pressure for **Section 230 Wars** as platforms face impossible content moderation burden (authentic vs synthetic)

## Warning Signs

- Perfect Deepfakes Achieved + Major False Flag Believed = International crisis or coup attempt
- High Forgery Rate + Low Verification Capacity = Courts cannot function, evidence-based justice collapses
- Widespread Synthesis Tools + Weak Authentication Standards = Revenge porn epidemic, personal attack surge
- Media Distrust + Deepfake Proliferation = History becomes unknowable, all documentation suspect
