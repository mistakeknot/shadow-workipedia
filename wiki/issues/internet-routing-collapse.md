# Internet Routing Collapse

## Overview

Internet routing collapse describes scenarios where the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) that routes traffic between networks fails at scale. BGP was designed for cooperation between trusted academic networks, not adversarial conditions. It has no built-in security and depends entirely on trust between network operators.
Modern civilization depends on internet connectivity for commerce, finance, communication, and infrastructure control. A coordinated attack on routing, table overflow crisis, or trust breakdown could fragment or disable the global internet, with consequences exceeding any previous infrastructure failure.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **BGP Hijacking Escalation**: Nation-state actors increasingly exploit BGP vulnerabilities to redirect traffic through their networks for surveillance or disruption. Trust in routing erodes.
- **Route Table Explosion**: Global routing tables grow beyond router memory capacity. Older infrastructure fails, fragmenting internet into disconnected islands.
- **Coordinated Routing Attack**: Attackers simultaneously inject false routing information at multiple points, creating cascading failures across the global internet. Recovery takes days.
- **Splinternet Routing Fragmentation**: Nations implement incompatible routing policies, deliberately fragmenting the internet into national or bloc-level networks that don't interoperate.
- **Routing Trust Collapse**: After major attacks, networks refuse to trust routing announcements from others. The cooperative model underlying internet routing breaks down.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Routing Failure** → **Financial System Halt**: Global financial networks depend on internet connectivity. Routing collapse freezes transactions, markets, and payment systems.
- **Communication Loss** → **Coordination Failure**: Organizations cannot communicate internally or externally. Supply chains, logistics, and emergency services lose coordination.
- **Trust Breakdown** → **Permanent Fragmentation**: Once routing trust is lost, rebuilding the cooperative model becomes politically impossible. Internet may never reunify.
- **Infrastructure Cascade** → **Physical Systems**: Industrial control systems, power grids, water treatment, and transportation increasingly depend on internet connectivity. Routing collapse has physical consequences.

## Warning Signs

- BGP hijacking incidents increasing in frequency and sophistication
- Major routing outages affecting millions of users
- Nations developing sovereign internet infrastructure
- Routing table size approaching hardware limits
- RPKI and other routing security measures seeing limited adoption
- State-sponsored routing manipulation documented
- Submarine cable damage causing regional routing stress
