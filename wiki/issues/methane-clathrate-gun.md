# Methane Clathrate Gun

## Overview

Methane clathrate gun describes the risk of rapid, large-scale methane release from frozen deposits in ocean sediments and permafrost. Methane hydrates represent a vast carbon reservoir that has remained stable for millennia but may destabilize as oceans warm.

While many models assume gradual release, faster destabilization would add substantial near-term warming, potentially triggering cascading tipping points and pushing the climate system toward harder-to-reverse trajectories.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Shallow Shelf Destabilization**: Arctic shelf warming produces anomalous regional methane spikes.
- **Methane Pulse Event**: Multiple deposits release in a short window, adding major warming on a multi-decade horizon.
- **Runaway Feedback Activation**: Methane-driven warming reinforces permafrost thaw and additional clathrate destabilization.
