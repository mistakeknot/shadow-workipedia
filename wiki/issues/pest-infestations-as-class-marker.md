# Pest Infestations as Class Marker

Bedbugs, cockroaches, and rodents have become reliable indicators of socioeconomic status in American cities, with pest infestations concentrated in low-income housing to a degree that reveals systematic inequality in basic living conditions. While wealthy neighborhoods invest in preventive pest control and can afford immediate professional remediation, poor communities endure chronic infestations that landlords ignore and residents cannot afford to address. The geography of pests maps precisely onto the geography of poverty, creating a visible biological marker of class that affects health, dignity, and economic opportunity.

The bedbug resurgence beginning in the 1990s has been particularly devastating for poor communities. The insects, which had been nearly eliminated in developed nations through DDT use, returned with resistance to modern pesticides and found ideal conditions in crowded, poorly maintained housing. Effective treatment requiring heat treatment or repeated professional pesticide applications costs thousands of dollars - unaffordable for those in infested housing. Residents face impossible choices: discard belongings they cannot replace, attempt ineffective DIY treatments, or simply endure the bites and psychological toll.

The stigma associated with infestations creates additional harm. Children from infested homes face bullying and social isolation. Adults may be fired or denied housing when infestations become known. The shame prevents people from seeking help or reporting problems to authorities. Meanwhile, the actual health impacts extend beyond bites - chronic infestations create stress, sleep deprivation, and psychological trauma. The insects serve as tiny but persistent reminders of poverty and powerlessness, their presence a daily indignity that wealthy people cannot imagine tolerating.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

**Housing Quality**: -11% (infestations in low-income housing)
**Public Health**: -8% (disease vectors, stress, sleep disruption)
**Social Inequality**: +10% (pest burden concentrated by class)
**Mental Health**: -9% (psychological impact of chronic infestation)
**Child Wellbeing**: -10% (school performance, social isolation)
**Social Stigma**: +12% (visible marker of poverty)
**Economic Opportunity**: -7% (job and housing discrimination)

### Cascading Effects

Poor housing maintenance → Pest infestations establish → Professional treatment unaffordable → Chronic infestation persists → Health and mental impacts accumulate → Social stigma and isolation → Children affected at school → Housing and employment discrimination → Poverty trap deepens

## Warning Signs

- Bedbug reports concentrated in low-income zip codes
- Professional pest control prices rising beyond reach of poor residents
- Landlord pest control obligations routinely unenforced
- School children experiencing bedbug-related bullying
- Pesticide resistance making treatment more difficult and expensive
- Public housing authorities unable to address infestations
- Heat treatment costs exceeding $2,000 per unit
- DIY pest control products proliferating (indicating unmet need)
- Tenant rights organizations overwhelmed with infestation complaints
- Psychological impact studies revealing trauma from chronic infestation
- Geographic pest maps correlating precisely with poverty maps
- Wealthy neighborhoods virtually pest-free while poor areas saturated
