# Iatrogenic Medical Harms

## Overview

Iatrogenic medical harms describes a systemic failure mode where a healthcare system designed to heal becomes a major source of injury and death through errors, infections, overtreatment, and automated decision failures. The key dynamic is institutional: overloaded care environments and perverse incentives amplify harm while suppressing learning and accountability.
As harms become visible and remediation fails, trust collapses, utilization patterns change, and the system’s ability to deliver safe care degrades further, creating a reinforcing loop.

## Game Mechanics

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Capacity Stress** -> **Error Rates**: Overload and staffing gaps increase mistakes, infections, and adverse drug events, worsening trust and utilization.
- **Automation Bias** -> **Accountability Vacuum**: AI triage and decision-support shift responsibility away from humans, complicating remediation when harm occurs.

## Warning Signs

- Rising adverse-event reports and hospital-acquired infection indicators alongside staffing shortages
- Evidence of systemic denial, underreporting, or retaliation against safety reporting
- Rapid expansion of clinical automation without validation or auditability
