# Sea-Level / Coastal Retreat Spiral

## Overview

The sea-level / coastal retreat spiral is the feedback loop where repeated coastal losses turn episodic disasters into structural financial and governance failure. As storm surge and chronic inundation increase, insurers reprice or exit, which freezes mortgages and collapses property values. Municipal tax bases erode, infrastructure maintenance falls behind, and retreat becomes the only viable option for many communities.

Retreat is not a single decision: it is a contested, unequal triage process. Hardening projects, zoning and disclosure rules, and relocation funding become political identity fights. When retreat is perceived as unfair—bailing out the connected while abandoning the vulnerable—trust collapses, and the spiral accelerates into migration pressure, homelessness, and wider regime instability.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Insurer Repricing Inflection**: Insurers rapidly reprice or exit after back-to-back losses.
- **Coastal Mortgage Freeze**: Credit and refinancing tighten as insurability becomes uncertain.
- **Municipal Triage Budget**: Cities formally decide which neighborhoods get hardening funds vs. retreat.
- **Port Relocation Crisis**: Port operators demand relocation/elevated rebuilds, triggering national supply-chain conflicts.
- **Saltwater Intrusion Water Collapse**: Aquifers become saline; rationing and emergency desalination deals trigger equity and corruption risk.
