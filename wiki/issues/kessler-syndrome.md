# Kessler Syndrome

## Overview

Kessler syndrome describes a cascading collision scenario where debris in Earth orbit triggers chain reactions creating more debris, eventually making orbital bands unusable. As orbit becomes more crowded, a single high-energy collision (or deliberate anti-satellite action) can generate thousands of fragments, each capable of further collisions.

Modern civilization depends on space infrastructure: GPS for navigation and timing, communications satellites for connectivity, weather satellites for forecasting, and military satellites for strategic stability. A sustained loss of orbital access would cripple transportation, agriculture, finance, and defense while potentially trapping humanity on Earth for generations.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Debris Collision Cascade**: A collision creates a large fragment cloud, increasing near-term collision probability.
- **Orbital Shell Denial**: Debris density makes new launches and replacements prohibitively risky.
- **Satellite Constellation Collapse**: Key constellations degrade faster than they can be replenished.
