# Quantum Computing Encryption Collapse

## Overview

Quantum computers represent an unprecedented threat to modern cryptography. Current encryption systems—RSA, ECC, and elliptic curve algorithms that secure everything from banking to military communications—rely on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithm problems. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm can solve these problems exponentially faster than classical computers, rendering current encryption virtually useless. The timeline is uncertain but accelerating: estimates range from 10-30 years before quantum computers achieve "cryptographically relevant" capability, though leading research organizations (NSA, NIST, China's quantum labs) are advancing faster than consensus predictions suggest.

The threat is compounded by "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks, where adversaries collect encrypted data today to decrypt once quantum computers mature. This means sensitive communications, state secrets, medical records, and financial transactions captured now are vulnerable retroactively. Governments and corporations are stockpiling encrypted data, banking on future decryption capability. The existential element: we cannot know what data has been harvested, making the current security posture fundamentally compromised at a temporal scale of decades.

The global race for post-quantum cryptography creates parallel risks. The transition from RSA to quantum-resistant algorithms (lattice-based, hash-based, multivariate polynomial schemes) will be the most complex cryptographic migration in history. Legacy systems, embedded devices, supply chains with 20-40 year operational lifespans, and millions of endpoints create a "transition collapse zone" where new and old systems must interoperate. Nation-states racing to develop quantum computers while simultaneously claiming post-quantum cryptographic superiority are incentivized to delay migration, maintain encryption backdoors, and gain temporal advantage.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

- **Quantum Computing Advancement** (0-100): Direct advancement in qubit count, coherence time, and error correction. Above 65 triggers cryptanalytic capability threats; above 85 enables breaking RSA-2048 in reasonable timeframes. Each 10-point increase reduces encryption security lifecycle by 3 years.

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography Adoption** (0-100): Percentage of critical systems transitioned to quantum-resistant algorithms. Below 30 creates cascading vulnerability windows; migration below 50 sustains legacy encryption dependencies. Each 1-point increase costs $500M-$2B globally in infrastructure updates.

- **Cryptographic Supply Chain Resilience** (0-100): Robustness of hardware security modules, key distribution systems, and supply chain cryptographic integrity. Below 40 enables "law enforcement backdoor" exploitation; below 20 permits state-level cryptographic injection attacks.

- **Data Harvesting Intelligence** (0-100): Estimated volume of encrypted data collected by adversaries for future decryption. Above 50 means petabytes of state secrets, military communications, and financial records are already captured. Each point above 70 represents critical national security documents in adversary possession.

- **Migration Coordination Capability** (0-100): International coordination on simultaneous cryptographic migration. Below 30 enables competitive advantage through delayed/selective migration; below 15 triggers unilateral cryptographic defaults creating incompatibility crises.

### Cascading Effects

- **Financial System Fragmentation**: Incompatible cryptographic standards between banking systems (US Federal Reserve, SWIFT, ECB, PBOC) create settlement failures, liquidity crunches, and regional banking collapses. Transaction processing slows from milliseconds to hours; derivative markets freeze; global trade finance halts.

- **Military Communication Collapse**: Armed forces lose secure communication capability during transition windows. Command-and-control systems fail; nuclear deterrent reliability questioned; regional powers exploit communication blackouts for territorial moves. Estimated 18-36 month vulnerability window per military across all services.

- **Government Secrets Retroactive Exposure**: Decades of diplomatic cables, intelligence assessments, and strategic planning documents become readable. Alliance structures, military capabilities, intelligence methods, negotiating positions are exposed. Geopolitical realignment follows from historical intelligence disclosure.

- **Critical Infrastructure Dual-Vulnerability**: Power grids, water treatment, transportation networks operate with both legacy encryption (vulnerable) and new post-quantum systems (untested). Attackers exploit transition period; simultaneous failures in multiple sectors possible.

- **Asymmetric Advantage Window**: Nation-states with early quantum capability maintain cryptographic advantage for 5-15 years during global transition. Surveillance capability, financial market manipulation, and espionage occur at scale while others believe they're secure. Advantage persists through deliberate migration delays.

## Warning Signs

- **Quantum Laboratory Announcements**: Chinese research institutes, IBM, Google, or other labs announce qubit count doubling, error correction breakthroughs, or "cryptographically relevant" capability timelines shifting from 20+ years to 10-15 years.

- **Classified NSA/CIA Cryptography Guidance Changes**: Sudden reclassification of quantum threat timelines, emergency procurement of post-quantum cryptography hardware, or unscheduled classified meetings on encryption indicate reassessment of threat acceleration.

- **Large-Scale Data Harvesting Detection**: Intelligence community detects state-level collection infrastructure targeting encrypted communications (fiber optic taps, satellite intercepts, endpoint infiltration). Volume in petabytes suggests systematic harvest for future decryption.

- **Supply Chain Cryptography Component Anomalies**: Security researchers or supply chain audits discover unexpected modifications to encryption hardware (HSMs, smart cards, cryptographic processors), unexplained key escrow mechanisms, or manufacturer-level backdoors.

- **Migration Coordination Breakdown**: NIST post-quantum standard adoption stalls at <40% by year 3 of transition period; nations announce competing proprietary standards; international cryptography coordination bodies (IETF, ETSI) fragment by geopolitical alignment.

- **Legacy System Incompatibility Incidents**: Banks report settlement failures, military services experience communication blackouts during dual-encryption operation, supply chains show transaction processing slowdowns. Indicates transition zone becoming operational reality rather than theoretical.

- **Unilateral Cryptographic Default Announcements**: China, Russia, or US announces national cryptographic standard unilaterally; other economies cannot verify security or interoperate. Creates parallel encryption ecosystems; financial/diplomatic communications fragment.
