# Planned Obsolescence as Environmental Crime

Consumer products are deliberately designed to fail or become obsolete within carefully calculated timeframes, transforming what could be durable goods into disposable waste streams that generate over 50 million tons of e-waste annually. Planned obsolescence has evolved from occasional practice to fundamental business model, with manufacturers engineering precise failure points, blocking repairs through proprietary parts and software locks, and using fashion cycles to psychologically obsolete perfectly functional products. The practice represents environmental vandalism at industrial scale, prioritizing short-term profits over resource conservation and climate stability.

The mechanisms of planned obsolescence are sophisticated and multifaceted. Physical obsolescence uses deliberately inferior components that fail predictably - printer cartridges with chips that stop working after arbitrary page counts, batteries glued into devices to prevent replacement, washing machines using plastic gears that fail after warranty expiration. Software obsolescence renders perfectly functional devices unusable through operating system updates that slow performance or eliminate app compatibility. Psychological obsolescence leverages fashion and feature cycles to make last year's model seem inadequate, creating waste through desire rather than malfunction.

The environmental and economic consequences are catastrophic. Resources extracted at great environmental cost are transformed into products designed to quickly become trash. Rare earth minerals mined through environmental destruction and human exploitation end up in landfills because products cannot be economically repaired. The linear take-make-dispose model consumes virgin resources while generating waste, when circular economy alternatives could extend product life many times over. The practice represents systematic wealth transfer from consumers to manufacturers while externalizing environmental costs onto society and future generations.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

**E-Waste Generation**: +16% (accelerated product replacement)
**Resource Depletion**: +12% (virgin materials vs. repair/reuse)
**Consumer Spending**: +11% (forced replacement purchases)
**Climate Emissions**: +9% (manufacturing and waste disposal)
**Corporate Profits**: +14% (planned repeat purchases)
**Product Durability**: -15% (engineered failure points)
**Circular Economy Progress**: -13% (repair blocked, linear model locked in)

### Cascading Effects

Planned obsolescence design → Product lifespan shortened → Replacement purchases increase → E-waste generation surges → Resource depletion accelerates → Manufacturing emissions rise → Landfills overflow → Circular economy progress blocked → Environmental degradation intensifies

## Warning Signs

- Average product lifespan declining below 5 years
- E-waste generation exceeding 60 million tons annually
- Right to repair legislation consistently blocked
- Manufacturer repair monopolies expanding
- Glued/sealed construction becoming standard
- Software updates disabling older devices
- Warranty periods decreasing while failure rates increase
- Independent repair shops closing due to manufacturer opposition
- Consumer spending on replacement vs. repair shifting dramatically
- Rare earth mining accelerating to feed replacement cycle
- Extended producer responsibility laws blocked by lobbying
- Circular economy market share stagnating below 10%
