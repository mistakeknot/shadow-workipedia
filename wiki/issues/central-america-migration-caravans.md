# Central America Migration Caravans

## Overview

The Northern Triangle—Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador—faces a perfect storm of gang violence, climate-driven agricultural collapse, and political corruption that makes survival increasingly impossible. Thousands organize into caravans seeking asylum in the United States, overwhelming both the asylum system and national processing capacity. These visible mass movements become flashpoints for anti-immigration politics, border militarization, and geopolitical tension between the US and Central American governments. The caravans represent not merely migration but systemic failure: when ordinary channels collapse, people self-organize into visible waves of desperation that destabilize receiving nations and accelerate political polarization.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Caravan Formation Pressure**: Increases when Northern Triangle violence, climate disasters, and poverty exceed escape thresholds simultaneously
- **Border Pressure**: Spikes sharply at Guatemala-Mexico and Mexico-US borders as caravan waves concentrate
- **Political Polarization**: Intensifies in US as visible caravans become election-year campaign fodder and far-right mobilization imagery
- **Northern Triangle Stability**: Deteriorates as gang violence and climate impacts accelerate departure waves
- **Asylum Processing Backlog**: Explodes as caravan arrivals overwhelm court systems designed for trickle-stream asylum
- **International Relations**: Deteriorates between US and Central American governments over border management and US deportation policies
- **Gang Control & Crime**: Paradoxically increases in origin countries as protective adults flee, leaving youth vulnerable to recruitment
- **Economic Migration Pressure**: Rises when agricultural collapse (drought, floods, soil degradation) destroys rural livelihoods

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Asylum System Breakdown** as caravan arrivals exceed processing capacity by 10x-100x normal volumes, creating collapse of intake systems
- Amplifies **Border Wall Politics** as visible caravans become justification for militarized borders, deportation acceleration, and funding for physical/technological barriers
- Can lead to **Gang Violence and Cartel Expansion** when gang leaders exploit caravan routes for human trafficking, drug smuggling, and recruitment of desperate migrants
- Creates pressure for **Xenophobia Rise** as caravan imagery becomes far-right propaganda fuel, normalizing anti-immigrant violence and rhetoric
- Intensifies **Democratic Backsliding** when governments use caravan emergencies to justify executive power grabs, emergency declarations, and erosion of judicial review
- Connects to **Climate Refugee Floods** as drought, floods, and agricultural collapse force migration waves that consolidate into organized caravans
- Worsens **Northern Triangle Gang Violence** as departure of protectors leaves youth and women vulnerable to recruitment and exploitation
- Accelerates **Economic Desperation Feedback Loop** when agricultural collapse and gang takeover of rural areas eliminates non-migration survival paths

## Warning Signs

- Northern Triangle Homicide Rate > 40/100k + Climate Disaster = Caravan Formation Imminent
- Asylum Processing Backlog > 2 Years + Border Arrivals Rising = Caravan Incentivizes
- Agricultural Collapse + Gang Control of Rural Areas = Economic Migration Wave
- US Anti-Immigration Rhetoric + Media Coverage = Caravan Political Weaponization
- Mexico Enforcement Pressure (US) + Caravan Rights Advocacy = Border Chaos
- Gang Infiltration in Caravan Routes + Low Enforcement = Human Trafficking Spike
- Election Year + Caravan Visibility + Polarized Media = Vigilante Border Violence
- Deportation Surge + Asylum Denials + Gang Recruitment = Return-Migration Capture
