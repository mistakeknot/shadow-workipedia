## Overview

Yemen's civil war, which erupted in 2014 with the Houthi takeover of the capital Sana'a, has evolved into one of the world's most devastating conflicts and a critical flashpoint for regional power dynamics. What began as a domestic political struggle between the internationally-recognized government and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement quickly transformed into a proxy battleground, with Saudi Arabia leading a multinational coalition intervening in March 2015 to restore the government and prevent Iranian expansion in the Arabian Peninsula. The conflict has since claimed an estimated 400,000+ lives through direct combat, disease, and starvation, with the United Nations characterizing the humanitarian situation as the world's worst ongoing crisis.

The human toll extends far beyond military casualties. Years of sustained coalition airstrikes targeting Houthi strongholds have destroyed critical civilian infrastructure—hospitals, water treatment facilities, food storage centers, and power plants—leaving 80% of Yemen's 30 million population dependent on humanitarian aid. The conflict has triggered widespread famine conditions, with millions facing severe acute malnutrition and millions more at risk of starvation. A complete breakdown in Yemen's healthcare system has enabled cholera outbreaks that kill thousands of vulnerable children, while recurring malaria epidemics add additional mortality. Economic collapse has rendered Yemen's currency nearly worthless, wages unpaid for years, and food prices skyrocketed beyond the purchasing power of ordinary Yemenis, creating a vicious cycle of humanitarian deterioration.

The conflict has increasingly internationalized, transforming from a regional proxy war into a global security concern. The Houthis, equipped with Iranian drones and missiles, have mounted sophisticated attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, claiming to retaliate against American and Israeli support for the Saudi-led coalition. These attacks on commercial vessels—including container ships and oil tankers from multiple nations—have disrupted critical global trade routes, pushed insurance costs skyward, and prompted military interventions by the United States, European nations, and others. This maritime dimension has entangled the Yemeni conflict with global supply chains, energy markets, and international security frameworks, elevating it beyond a regional concern to a challenge affecting worldwide economic stability and international commerce.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects
- **Regional Instability**: +70 (Gulf tensions, proxy warfare, spillover risk to neighbors)
- **Humanitarian Need**: +90 (famine, disease, displacement, systematic infrastructure collapse)
- **Shipping Security**: -50 (Houthi Red Sea attacks, insurance costs, route diversions)
- **Energy Market Volatility**: +35 (Gulf infrastructure threats, Saudi focus on Yemen vs. production)
- **State Fragmentation**: +75 (parallel governments, territorial control disputes, institutional breakdown)
- **Refugee/Migration Pressure**: +55 (internal displacement, cross-border flows to neighboring countries)

## Cascading Effects

Yemen's conflict connects to and amplifies multiple global crises:

- **Saudi-Iran Rivalry**: Yemen serves as the primary proxy battleground where both powers project influence without direct military confrontation. Escalations in Yemen correlate with broader Saudi-Iranian tensions, nuclear negotiations, and oil market competition.

- **Global Shipping Disruptions**: Houthi control of coastal territory and proven capability to strike vessels has made the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden among the world's most dangerous shipping lanes, forcing vessels to take expensive detours around Africa and raising costs for global trade and energy transport.

- **Humanitarian System Strain**: Yemen represents the largest humanitarian operation globally, with aid organizations operating under extreme constraints. Resource diversion to Yemen's crisis competes with response capacity for other global emergencies, demonstrating the finite nature of international humanitarian resources.

- **Regional Destabilization**: Yemen's collapse threatens spillover effects into Saudi Arabia, Oman, and other neighbors through refugee flows, militant recruitment, and cross-border security threats.

- **International Norms Erosion**: Documented civilian casualties from coalition strikes and Houthi attacks on civilian targets have challenged international humanitarian law enforcement and demonstrated the difficulty of accountability in modern conflicts.

## Warning Signs

- **Escalating Houthi Capabilities**: Increased frequency and sophistication of drone and missile attacks on international shipping, reaching further into the Red Sea and Arabian Sea
- **Port and Trade Disruptions**: Major shipping companies rerouting away from Red Sea routes, insurance premiums surging, alternative route utilization increasing
- **Food Price Spikes and Import Blockades**: Sudden interruptions to port access, failed harvests, or currency collapses driving rapid food cost increases beyond household purchasing power
- **Disease Outbreak Reports**: Sudden cholera case increases, measles epidemics, or novel disease emergence in crowded displacement camps
- **Failed Ceasefire Negotiations**: Recurring breakdown of UN-mediated peace efforts despite international pressure
- **Coalition Attrition Signals**: Saudi Arabia and UAE reducing military commitment or signaling withdrawal, creating security vacuums
- **Hospital Closures and Medical System Collapse**: Healthcare facility destruction or funding cuts triggering mass casualty events from preventable diseases
- **Refugee Flow Increases**: Sudden upticks in Yemenis crossing into Saudi Arabia, Oman, or attempting sea migration to Horn of Africa
