# Corporate Sovereignty and Neo-Feudalism

## Overview

Corporate sovereignty describes the expansion of corporate power into domains traditionally reserved for government: housing, law enforcement, courts, social services, and territorial governance. As states weaken and corporations strengthen, the balance of power shifts toward a neo-feudal arrangement.
Company towns of the industrial era are reviving in tech-enabled form. Platform companies mediate access to economic participation. Special economic zones grant corporations governmental powers. The endpoint is a system where citizenship matters less than corporate relationship, and workers' rights depend on employer benevolence rather than law.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Company Town Revival**: Tech and logistics giants build purpose-built communities where they control housing, services, and local governance. Workers depend entirely on employer for life necessities.
- **Corporate Jurisdiction Expansion**: Special economic zones grant corporations governmental powers: taxation, law enforcement, courts. Corporate governance replaces democratic accountability.
- **Platform Citizenship Emergence**: Workers' access to healthcare, housing, credit, and social services becomes contingent on platform relationship. Deplatforming means loss of life necessities.
- **Corporate Arbitration Dominance**: Mandatory arbitration clauses remove disputes from public courts. Corporate-appointed arbitrators consistently rule against workers and consumers.
- **Regulatory Capture Completion**: Revolving door between industry and regulators eliminates meaningful oversight. Regulations are written by and for regulated industries.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Housing Control** → **Labor Coercion**: When employers control housing, workers cannot leave without becoming homeless. Labor mobility disappears and bargaining power collapses.
- **Platform Dependency** → **Social Control**: When all life services flow through corporate platforms, deplatforming becomes exile from society. Dissent becomes impossible.
- **Regulatory Capture** → **Accountability Void**: Without meaningful regulation, corporations face no constraint on exploitation. Public interest disappears from governance.
- **Democratic Erosion** → **Formal Feudalism**: Corporate power eventually seeks and achieves formal governmental authority. Citizenship gives way to employment as basis for rights.

## Warning Signs

- Major employers building residential communities for workers
- Special economic zones expanding corporate governmental powers
- Mandatory arbitration covering majority of workforce
- Gig workers classified as contractors losing employee protections
- Platform account status affecting access to housing, banking, services
- Regulatory agencies staffed predominantly by industry veterans
- Corporate lobbying expenditure exceeding government agency budgets
