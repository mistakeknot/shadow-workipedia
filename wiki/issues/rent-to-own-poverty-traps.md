# Rent-to-Own Poverty Traps

## Overview

Rent-to-own schemes for furniture, appliances, electronics, and increasingly housing represent predatory financial products that exploit poverty and poor credit access to extract extraordinary wealth from vulnerable populations. These arrangements promise ownership through affordable weekly or monthly payments but conceal effective interest rates ranging from 100% to 400% APR, making products cost 3-5 times their retail value. The business model depends on customer failure: most consumers never complete the payment schedule, losing all equity when they miss payments, allowing the same item to be rented repeatedly to different customers.

The mechanisms are deliberately designed to trap customers in cycles of partial payment and repossession. Weekly payment schedules maximize transaction fees and create frequent default opportunities. Aggressive repossession policies—often triggered after a single missed payment—ensure inventory returns for re-rental. Contracts contain arbitration clauses blocking legal challenges, "perpetual rental" provisions preventing equity accumulation, and confusing terms that obscure true costs. The industry targets communities with limited credit access, positioning expensive credit as the only path to essential goods.

The societal consequences extend beyond individual financial harm. Families cycle through furniture and appliances without building assets, diverting income from savings or investment. The stress of managing high-frequency payment schedules contributes to mental health problems and family instability. Children grow up witnessing asset forfeiture, normalizing predatory finance. Communities with high rent-to-own penetration experience wealth extraction that depresses local economic development. The normalization of 300% APR payment plans erodes expectations of fair finance, creating acceptance of exploitation as inevitable.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects
- **Household Debt** (Low-Income): +25 to +40
- **Asset Accumulation** (Poor): -30 to -50
- **Financial Stress**: +20 to +35
- **Consumer Protection**: -25 to -45
- **Economic Mobility**: -15 to -30
- **Mental Health** (Customers): -10 to -20
- **Community Wealth**: -15 to -25

### Cascading Effects
- Families repeatedly lose appliances/furniture, must re-rent same items
- Credit scores worsen (if reported), limiting future access
- Savings depleted paying for overpriced goods
- Stress contributes to health problems, workplace issues
- Children's education disrupted (no computer, desk, etc.)
- Community wealth extracted to corporate shareholders
- Alternatives (saving for purchase) become culturally foreign
- Poverty self-perpetuates through asset destruction
- Political support for predatory finance regulation undermined by industry lobbying

## Warning Signs

**Early Indicators**:
- Rent-to-own stores proliferate in low-income neighborhoods
- Advertising emphasizes "no credit check" and "low weekly payments"
- Consumer complaints about repossession practices increase
- Effective APR calculations reveal 200%+ rates
- Industry lobbying against interest rate caps intensifies
- Rent-to-own models expand into new product categories

**Critical Triggers**:
- Major retailer enters rent-to-own market
- Rent-to-own applied to housing at scale
- State eliminates interest rate caps
- Federal consumer protection enforcement ceases
- Rent-to-own industry consolidates (reduces competition)
- Contracts begin reporting to credit bureaus
- Industry-funded research claims rent-to-own benefits poor
- Legal challenges to arbitration clauses fail
