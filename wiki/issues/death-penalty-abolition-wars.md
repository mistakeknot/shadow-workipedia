# Death Penalty Abolition Wars

## Overview

The death penalty abolition wars represent a deep ideological and legal struggle between capital punishment advocates and abolitionists, playing out across state legislatures, international organizations, and courtrooms. As of 2025, 23 U.S. states have abolished capital punishment entirely, while 27 states retain it—though many have not executed a prisoner in 10+ years. This creates a fractured landscape where execution protocols, sentencing practices, and definitions of "cruel and unusual punishment" vary dramatically by jurisdiction.

International pressure intensifies the conflict: the European Union conditions membership and trade agreements on capital punishment abolition, while countries like China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore maintain high execution rates. The United States executes far fewer prisoners than authoritarian regimes but remains among Western democracies as an outlier—a fact that drives significant diplomatic friction. Within the U.S., the abolitionist movement has successfully leveraged DNA exoneration evidence (21 death row exonerations since 1973 in capital cases) and execution botches to argue for systemic failure, while retentionists frame capital punishment as necessary justice for the most severe crimes.

Public opinion on capital punishment has shifted dramatically: support among Americans has declined from 80% in 1994 to 54% in 2024, with stark partisan and racial divides. Black Americans and Democrats support abolition at much higher rates than white Americans and Republicans. This issue functions as a proxy for larger debates about justice, race, state power, and what constitutes acceptable state violence—making it a flashpoint for political conflict across criminal justice reform, racial equality, and constitutional interpretation.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Criminal Justice System Legitimacy**: Execution-related incidents (botches, exonerations, racial disparities in sentencing) reduce public trust by 3-8% per event. States with recent high-profile execution failures experience 12-18% drops in convictions for serious crimes as juries become reluctant to return death sentences. Conversely, highly publicized victim advocacy campaigns restore legitimacy by 2-4%, temporarily increasing jury willingness to impose death sentences.

- **Political Polarization**: The death penalty functions as a "wedge issue" driving 8-15 percentage point increases in partisan voting divergence on criminal justice and constitutional interpretation. Campaigns centered on capital punishment can move swing state voting by 2-4 percentage points, particularly in rural and Southern regions where execution debates activate core conservative voters.

- **Interstate Legal Variance**: Abolition in neighboring states creates regulatory pressure: jurors in retention states exposed to abolitionist narratives show 6-12% lower death sentence rates. Conversely, if neighboring states maintain capital punishment, abolition campaigns face 15-25% greater public resistance.

- **International Diplomatic Relations**: U.S. capital punishment and high execution rates generate diplomatic friction with trading partners and allies. Countries may impose tariffs, restrict imports, or condition agreements on abolition, reducing trade flows by 0.3-0.8% for high-execution states.

- **Racial Justice Metrics**: Death row populations have ~42% Black representation despite Black Americans comprising ~13% of the U.S. population. Persistent racial disparities in sentencing and execution rates amplify **racial-justice-reckoning** by 5-10% whenever exonerations or high-profile cases surface systemic bias.

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **criminal-justice-reform** efforts when execution botches exceed 2 within 24 months or exonerations reach 3+ in a single state
- Amplifies **racial-justice-reckoning** by 5-15% when death row racial disparities become public or exonerations involve racial bias cases
- Amplifies **mass-incarceration-crisis** by 3-8% through spillover effects: abolitionist organizing invests in broader carceral reform, shifting resources from death penalty focus to mass incarceration advocacy
- Amplifies **international-human-rights** activism by 8-12% when diplomatic friction escalates or U.S. execution rates compared publicly to authoritarian regimes
- Triggers **political-polarization** acceleration by 10-15% if wedge-issue campaigns weaponize capital punishment debate during elections

## Warning Signs

**Early Indicators of Escalation:**

- **Execution Frequency + Botch Risk** = Multiple executions scheduled in same jurisdiction within short window, with jurisdiction having history of botches or procedural problems; increases likelihood of catastrophic failure (-8-12% legitimacy, +15-25% abolitionist momentum)

- **Racial Disparity Exposure + Media Attention** = Investigative journalism reveals systemic racial bias in death sentencing; coincides with exoneration of defendant from underrepresented group; triggers 5-10% swing toward abolition, 20-30% increase in civil rights litigation

- **Public Opinion Shift + Jury Behavior** = National abolition support exceeds 50% (crossed in 2020); simultaneously, conviction rates for death-eligible crimes decline by 8-15% in retention states as juries increasingly reject death sentences despite prosecution requests

- **Interstate Abolition Cascade + Political Mobilization** = Three or more states legislate abolition within 5-year window; retentionists respond with constitutional amendment efforts and "tough on crime" campaigns, but abolitionist momentum exceeds retention momentum by 2-3:1 organizing ratio

- **Diplomatic Pressure + Economic Consequences** = Trade partners publicly condition agreements on abolition, withdraw investment from high-execution states, or countries boycott imports; creates economic constituency for abolition among business interests (typically conservative allies of retention)

- **Wrongful Conviction Acceleration + Institutional Failure** = Exoneration rate in a state exceeds 1 per 100 executions; combined with evidence of prosecutorial misconduct, eyewitness misidentification, or inadequate counsel in capital cases; triggers major criminal justice legitimacy crisis (-10-15%), accelerates abolition timeline by 5-10 years

- **Victim Advocacy Fragmentation** = Victim families split between retentionist and abolitionist positions; high-profile victim family members publicly oppose execution of convicted prisoner in their case; reduces retentionist messaging power by 20-30%, enables nuanced policy debates that favor reform/abolition
