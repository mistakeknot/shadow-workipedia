# Shadow Banking Contagion

## Overview

Shadow banking contagion describes systemic risk from non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) including hedge funds, private credit funds, money market funds, and insurance companies. These institutions now hold assets rivaling traditional banks but operate outside prudential regulation, with higher leverage and less transparent interconnections.
Post-2008 reforms pushed risk from regulated banks into shadow banking. When stress hits, NBFIs face liquidity crises they cannot survive without central bank intervention—but extending the safety net to unregulated entities creates moral hazard and political legitimacy problems. A recent UK pension crisis and repeated repo market interventions demonstrate this vulnerability is real and growing.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **NBFI Liquidity Crisis**: A major non-bank financial intermediary faces redemption demands it cannot meet, triggering fire sales and contagion to connected institutions.
- **Private Credit Default Wave**: Rising rates expose overleveraged private credit portfolios, causing losses that cascade through pension funds and insurance companies.
- **Hedge Fund Margin Call Cascade**: Correlated positions across hedge funds trigger simultaneous margin calls, forcing synchronized deleveraging that amplifies market moves.
- **Repo Market Seizure**: Short-term funding markets freeze as counterparty risk fears spike, cutting off liquidity to institutions dependent on overnight borrowing.
- **Central Bank NBFI Bailout**: Regulators extend emergency lending to shadow banks, creating moral hazard and political backlash over privatized gains and socialized losses.
- **Regulatory Perimeter Expansion**: Post-crisis reforms extend bank-like regulation to NBFIs, triggering industry restructuring and migration to new unregulated vehicles.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **NBFI Stress** -> **Bank Contagion**: Shadow banks and traditional banks are deeply interconnected through lending, derivatives, and shared exposures. NBFI failures transmit rapidly to regulated banking sector.
- **Fire Sales** -> **Asset Price Collapse**: Forced selling by distressed NBFIs depresses asset prices, triggering margin calls and redemptions at other institutions, creating self-reinforcing downward spiral.
- **Repo Freeze** -> **Liquidity Crisis**: Shadow banks depend on short-term funding markets. When repo markets seize, even solvent institutions face immediate liquidity crises and potential failure.
- **Bailout Politics** -> **Regulatory Backlash**: Public anger over bailing out unregulated institutions creates political pressure for aggressive regulation, potentially overshooting and constraining credit availability.

## Warning Signs

- Non-bank financial assets growing faster than regulated bank assets
- Leverage levels at hedge funds and private credit funds reaching historic highs
- Concentration of similar positions across multiple large funds
- Repo market stress indicators (spreads, volumes) showing strain
- Private credit deals with loose covenants and payment-in-kind features proliferating
- Insurance companies and pensions increasing allocations to illiquid alternatives
- Regulatory warnings about NBFI systemic risk going unaddressed
- Correlation spikes across asset classes during stress episodes
- Central banks expressing concern about shadow banking visibility gaps
- Credit spreads diverging between bank and non-bank lending
