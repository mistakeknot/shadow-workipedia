# CBDC Financial Surveillance State

## Overview

CBDC financial surveillance state describes the risk that central bank digital currencies become instruments of comprehensive financial surveillance and behavioral control. Unlike cash or even bank deposits, CBDCs can be designed with full transaction visibility, programmable restrictions, and instant freezing capabilities.
The transition from cash to CBDCs eliminates anonymous transactions, enables real-time monitoring of all economic activity, and creates infrastructure for programmable money that can be expired, geographically restricted, or limited to approved categories. Combined with social credit systems, CBDCs could enable unprecedented state control over individual economic behavior.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Major CBDC Launch**: A G20 economy launches a retail CBDC, establishing precedent for digital currency adoption and normalizing state visibility into transactions.
- **Programmable Money Restrictions**: Authorities implement spending controls—expiration dates, geographic limits, or category restrictions—demonstrating programmable money's coercive potential.
- **Cash Phase-Out Acceleration**: Governments accelerate cash elimination through transaction limits, bank branch closures, and merchant incentives, removing anonymous payment options.
- **Financial Deplatforming Incident**: Dissidents, protesters, or disfavored groups have CBDC access frozen or restricted, demonstrating political weaponization of digital currency.
- **Cross-Border CBDC Surveillance Treaty**: Nations establish CBDC interoperability agreements with surveillance data sharing, creating global financial tracking infrastructure.
- **Privacy-Preserving CBDC Alternative**: Civil society pressure forces adoption of privacy-protecting CBDC designs, creating divergent models between authoritarian and democratic states.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **CBDC Adoption** -> **Cash Elimination**: Once CBDCs reach critical mass, governments accelerate cash phase-out. Anonymous transactions become impossible, creating total financial visibility.
- **Financial Surveillance** -> **Political Control**: Transaction monitoring enables preemptive identification of dissent. Donations to opposition, attendance at protests, and 'suspicious' purchases trigger automated flags.
- **Programmable Money** -> **Behavioral Engineering**: Expiration dates force spending during downturns; geographic restrictions prevent capital flight; category limits enforce consumption patterns. Money becomes a policy tool.
- **Cross-Border Integration** -> **Global Surveillance Net**: CBDC interoperability agreements share transaction data across jurisdictions, enabling coordinated tracking of individuals across borders.

## Warning Signs

- Central banks announcing CBDC pilot programs and public consultations
- Cash transaction limits being lowered or new reporting requirements imposed
- Bank branch closures accelerating in rural and low-income areas
- Merchant incentives to refuse cash or charge cash-handling fees
- Social credit integration with financial services in authoritarian states
- CBDC designs explicitly including programmability features
- Financial sanctions expanding to individuals and small organizations
- Privacy advocates raising alarms about CBDC architecture choices
- Cross-border CBDC collaboration frameworks being negotiated
- Stablecoin crackdowns justified by CBDC competition concerns
