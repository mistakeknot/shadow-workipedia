# Global Food Waste Crisis

## Overview

Global food waste crisis describes the paradox of a large share of food produced globally being lost or wasted while hunger persists at massive scale. This waste occurs throughout supply chains: post-harvest losses in developing regions, cosmetic standards rejecting edible produce, retail overstocking, and consumer disposal.
Food waste is not merely an efficiency problem but a climate crisis contributor—if food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter. Every wasted calorie represents wasted water, fertilizer, energy, and land. Reducing waste offers a rare opportunity to simultaneously address food security, climate change, and resource depletion without increasing agricultural production.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Food Waste Emissions Reckoning**: Climate accounting reveals food waste as third-largest emissions source globally, triggering regulatory and corporate response.
- **Retailer Cosmetic Standard Scandal**: Investigation exposes massive waste from cosmetic food standards, with perfectly edible produce rejected for appearance, sparking consumer backlash.
- **Food Rescue Infrastructure Collapse**: Food banks and rescue organizations overwhelmed as both waste and hunger increase simultaneously, highlighting distribution failure.
- **Landfill Methane Crisis**: Food waste in landfills generates methane at rates exceeding estimates, forcing emergency diversion mandates in multiple jurisdictions.
- **Post-Harvest Loss Famine**: Developing region experiences famine despite adequate production due to storage and transportation losses, highlighting infrastructure gap.
- **Food Waste Liability Legislation**: Nations pass laws mandating food waste reduction with corporate penalties, forcing supply chain restructuring.
- **Consumer Behavior Shift Campaign**: Major campaign changes consumer attitudes toward imperfect produce and expiration dates, demonstrating cultural change potential.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Production Waste** -> **Resource Multiplication**: Every ton of wasted food represents wasted water, fertilizer, energy, and land. Reducing waste is equivalent to increasing production without additional resource extraction.
- **Retail Standards** -> **Upstream Waste**: Cosmetic standards for produce appearance can cause farmers to discard a large share of harvests. Standards set by retailers cascade backward through supply chains.
- **Landfill Disposal** -> **Methane Emissions**: Food waste in landfills decomposes anaerobically, generating methane that is far more potent than CO2 in the near term. Food waste is a major climate driver.
- **Waste Alongside Hunger** -> **Distribution Failure**: A large share of food is wasted while hunger persists at massive scale, revealing distribution system failure rather than production insufficiency. The problem is allocation, not quantity.

## Warning Signs

- Food waste measured as percentage of production remaining stable or increasing
- Climate inventories highlighting food waste emissions contribution
- Food banks reporting simultaneous waste increase and demand increase
- Retail cosmetic standards causing documented farm-level waste
- Post-harvest losses in developing regions remaining high or worsening
- Landfill diversion mandates being proposed or enacted
- Consumer awareness campaigns gaining traction
- Restaurant and institutional food waste being measured and publicized
- Date labeling confusion causing unnecessary household waste
- Agricultural inputs (water, fertilizer) wasted through food loss being quantified
