# Aging Population Burden

## Overview

Developed nations face demographic collapse as birth rates plummet while lifespans extend, creating inverted population pyramids where the elderly vastly outnumber the young. Pension systems built for 3 workers per retiree face insolvency with ratios dropping to 1.5:1 or worse, while healthcare costs for aging populations consume ever-larger shares of GDP, leaving shrinking workforces crushed under the burden of supporting previous generations.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Pension Solvency**: Decreases sharply as worker-to-retiree ratios collapse and dependency costs rise
- **Healthcare Demand**: Increases dramatically, straining hospital capacity and forcing priority decisions
- **Labor Force Ratio**: Declines as working-age population shrinks relative to dependents
- **Elder Care Capacity**: Becomes critical bottleneck as shortage of care workers worsens
- **Intergenerational Equity**: Declines as youth face tax burden and reduced opportunity while supporting elderly
- **Economic Productivity**: Stagnates as healthcare/pension spending crowds out investment in innovation
- **Immigration Pressure**: Increases as nations seek younger workers and tax bases to support aging populations

**Event Types:**
1. **Pension Fund Crisis**: Major pension system faces insolvency, forcing benefit cuts or tax increases
2. **Elder Care Shortage**: Insufficient caregivers creates dangerous conditions; care homes overflowing
3. **Retirement Age Increase**: Government raises retirement age, triggering youth unemployment and elder resentment
4. **Healthcare Rationing**: Scarce resources force difficult prioritization decisions; some treatments become unavailable
5. **Immigration Policy Shift**: Nations rapidly liberalize (or reactively restrict) immigration to address labor shortages
6. **Workforce Automation Push**: Employers aggressively automate to reduce reliance on shrinking labor force
7. **Intergenerational Revolt**: Youth protest unfair burden of supporting retirees; tax resistance grows

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Healthcare System Collapse** as aging demand overwhelms capacity and funding
- Exacerbates **AI Job Displacement Tsunami** as automation becomes "solution" to worker shortage
- Creates conditions for **Climate Refugee Floods** as wealthy nations compete for young workers/tax bases
- Worsens **Birth Rate Collapse** as young people delay/skip parenthood due to economic burden and debt
- Drives pressure for **Universal Basic Income Trials** as traditional welfare systems prove unsustainable
- Can lead to **Authoritarian Surge** if governments scapegoat immigrants or enforce unpopular austerity

## Warning Signs

- Low Birth Rate (Below 1.5) + High Life Expectancy = Demographic time bomb
- Pension Contributions Rising + Benefits Falling = System instability worsening
- Healthcare Costs Exceeding 15% of GDP + Aging Population = Fiscal crisis imminent
- Skilled Worker Shortage + Wage Stagnation = Immigration conflict brewing
- Youth Unemployment + Mandatory Retirement Support = Intergenerational conflict escalating
- Long-term Care Facilities Full + Caregiver Shortage = Elder abuse and care crisis
