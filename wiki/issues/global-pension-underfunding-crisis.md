# Global Pension Underfunding Crisis

## Overview

Global pension underfunding crisis describes the growing gap between promised retirement benefits and assets available to pay them. Defined benefit pensions— both public and private—were designed for different demographics, interest rates, and return expectations than many modern conditions.
The math is increasingly unavoidable: longer lifespans, lower birth rates, and lower investment returns mean systems are structurally underfunded. The political economy makes reform nearly impossible—existing retirees vote, future retirees don't. The result is a slow-motion crisis that will force painful adjustments through benefit cuts, tax increases, or retirement age changes when the money simply runs out.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Major Pension Fund Insolvency**: A large public or corporate pension fund announces it cannot meet obligations, triggering benefit cuts and political crisis.
- **Retirement Age Shock Increase**: Government announces significant retirement age increase, sparking mass protests and generational conflict.
- **Pension Benefit Haircut**: Retirees receive notice of reduced benefits as fund acknowledges it cannot meet promised payments, creating immediate hardship.
- **Public Pension Bailout Debate**: Legislature debates using general tax revenue to cover pension shortfalls, intensifying conflict between generations and regions.
- **Corporate Pension Dump**: Companies offload pension liabilities through bankruptcy or transfers to underfunded government insurance programs.
- **Pension Investment Scandal**: Revelations that pension funds chased yield into risky or fraudulent investments, accelerating losses and eroding trust.
- **Defined Benefit Extinction**: Remaining defined benefit plans close to new workers, completing shift of retirement risk from employers to individuals.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Funding Gap** -> **Benefit Cuts**: When pension math becomes undeniable, benefits must be cut. Retirees who planned on promised income face sudden poverty, overwhelming social safety nets.
- **Demographic Squeeze** -> **Contribution Crisis**: Shrinking workforces cannot sustain pay-as-you-go systems designed for different ratios. Contribution rates must rise unsustainably or benefits must fall.
- **Low Returns** -> **Assumption Failure**: Pension assumptions built on historical returns face lower-for-longer interest rates. The gap between assumed and actual returns compounds into massive unfunded liabilities.
- **Intergenerational Conflict** -> **Political Instability**: Young workers asked to fund benefits they won't receive resist. Retirees defending earned benefits vote. The conflict paralyzes reform until crisis forces action.

## Warning Signs

- Pension funding ratios declining across multiple large funds
- Actuarial assumption returns exceeding realistic market expectations
- Worker-to-retiree ratios falling below sustainable levels
- Pension contribution rates consuming growing share of government budgets
- Corporate pension freezes and terminations accelerating
- Pension funds increasing allocation to illiquid/risky assets to chase returns
- Political debates about retirement age becoming increasingly contentious
- Young workers expressing belief they will never receive promised benefits
- Multiemployer pension plans entering critical status
- State and municipal credit ratings downgraded due to pension liabilities
