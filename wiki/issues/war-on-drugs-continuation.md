## Overview

The global war on drugs, declared formally by the United States in 1971 and subsequently adopted by international policy frameworks, has persisted for over five decades despite mounting evidence of its systemic failure. Based on prohibition of psychoactive substances and criminalization of their use and distribution, this approach has consumed trillions of dollars in enforcement, incarceration, and interdiction efforts while failing to reduce drug consumption rates or availability. Instead, prohibition has created massive secondary harms: skyrocketing mass incarceration, particularly affecting minority populations and low-income communities; the emergence of powerful criminal organizations that control entire regions; environmental devastation from drug manufacturing; and a public health crisis that intensifies when users shift to increasingly dangerous substances like fentanyl to circumvent enforcement. The policy perpetuates itself through institutional inertia, political risk-aversion, and the entrenched interests of criminal justice, law enforcement, and prison systems that have become economically dependent on drug prohibition.

Contemporary evidence increasingly demonstrates that countries and regions employing alternative approaches—decriminalization, harm reduction, treatment-focused models, and regulated access—achieve superior public health outcomes, lower crime rates, and stronger community cohesion. Portugal's 1994 decriminalization policy, combined with investment in treatment and social integration, eliminated its heroin epidemic and dramatically reduced related harms. Switzerland's heroin-assisted treatment programs achieved 95% employment rates among participants and eliminated street drug markets in targeted neighborhoods. Meanwhile, the United States and countries maintaining strict prohibition continue to experience rising overdose deaths, prison populations that dwarf those of other developed nations, and entrenched cartels with military capabilities. The continuation of drug prohibition thus represents not evidence-based policy but institutional and political lock-in, where decades of investment in enforcement infrastructure create constituencies opposed to reform and policymakers fear being portrayed as "soft on drugs."

The continuation of global drug prohibition policies will intensify all three vectors of harm: the public health crisis will worsen as fentanyl and synthetic opioids proliferate; criminal organizations will grow stronger and more geopolitically destabilizing, particularly in vulnerable states; and mass incarceration will perpetuate intergenerational poverty and social fragmentation in affected communities. The policy creates a perverse incentive structure in which enforcement success (seizing drugs, imprisoning distributors) is measured independently of population health outcomes, allowing governments to declare victory while overdose deaths accelerate and communities deteriorate. Without fundamental policy shift toward evidence-based harm reduction and decriminalization, the war on drugs will continue consuming resources, destabilizing regions, destroying lives, and generating profits for criminal enterprises—all while failing at its stated objective of reducing drug use.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects
- **Criminal Justice Load**: +40 (incarceration rates, court backlogs)
- **Public Health Strain**: +35 (overdose deaths, HIV transmission)
- **Border Security Costs**: +30 (interdiction operations)
- **Social Cohesion**: -25 (community disruption from enforcement)

### Event Types
- Fentanyl overdose spikes
- Cartel territory wars
- Prison overcrowding crises
- Decriminalization reform movements
- Drug trafficking interdiction operations
- Treatment program defunding

## Cascading Effects

The War on Drugs creates feedback loops with:
- **Mass Incarceration Crisis**: Drug offenses drive prison populations, creating permanent underclasses and destabilizing communities
- **Mexican Cartel Violence**: Prohibition creates black markets and extraordinary profits that fund militarization of criminal organizations
- **Opioid Crisis**: Enforcement pushes users to more dangerous substances; fentanyl emerges as black market replacement for heroin
- **Public Health System Strain**: Limited resources diverted from prevention and treatment to incarceration and enforcement
- **Geopolitical Instability**: Cartel power destabilizes states and creates migration pressures

## Warning Signs

- Rising overdose death rates despite enforcement intensity
- Prison population growth outpacing crime rates
- Growing public support for decriminalization in developed nations
- International policy divergence accelerating (EU vs. traditional enforcers)
- Cartel violence expanding into new regions and increasing lethality
- Synthetic opioid emergence outpacing enforcement capability
- Treatment waiting lists extending; inadequate funding for alternatives
- Racial disparities in drug enforcement and incarceration widening
