# Billionaire Abolition Movement

## Overview

The Billionaire Abolition Movement represents a coordinated global campaign to eliminate billionaire-class wealth through progressive taxation, wealth caps, and structural economic reforms. Emerging in response to extreme wealth concentration—where the wealthiest 1% now controls more wealth than the middle 60% of the global population—the movement advocates for mandatory wealth taxes (1-5% annually on fortunes exceeding $1 billion), confiscatory estate taxes (up to 100% on amounts over $1 billion), and restrictions on wealth accumulation mechanisms.

The movement encompasses grassroots activists, economists, labor unions, and political parties across 45+ countries. Mechanically, billionaire wealth translates directly into political influence: a single billionaire donor can fund 10,000+ political advertisements, hire specialized lobbying firms, and capture regulatory agencies. The movement argues this concentration has eroded democratic institutions—43% of campaign funding in wealthy democracies comes from billionaires and their foundations, and billionaire-owned media outlets shape political discourse in 68% of developed nations.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Wealth Inequality Index**: Activism accelerates when Gini coefficient exceeds 0.65; triggers 8-15% increases in protest frequency and political mobilization. Successful wealth cap legislation reduces index by 3-6 points over 5 years.

- **Political Capture Index**: Billionaire influence drops 12-25% when wealth taxation gains traction; reduces oligarchic control score, forces regulatory independence, and shifts campaign finance landscape.

- **Tax Resistance**: Ultra-wealthy interests mobilize capital flight, regulatory capture, and media campaigns to block taxation. Capital flight triggers when wealth taxes exceed 3% annually, relocating 15-30% of taxable billionaire assets to tax havens.

- **Democratic Legitimacy**: Successful wealth redistribution increases public trust in democratic institutions by 5-12%; failure to address billionaire influence erodes legitimacy by 8-18% annually.

- **Class Consciousness**: Movement growth accelerates polarization between working/middle class and ultra-wealthy, increasing class-conflict scores by 10-20 points and triggering labor radicalization events.

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **democratic-backsliding** when political capture exceeds 75%; billionaires fund authoritarian movements to preserve wealth
- Amplifies **oligarchic-control** by 20-35% if wealth caps fail; demonstrates ineffectiveness of democratic mechanisms for wealth redistribution
- Triggers **revolution-risk** when class consciousness reaches critical threshold (>8.5/10) + unemployment exceeds 12%
- Amplifies **wealth-concentration-crisis** by 15-25% if capital flight succeeds and wealth consolidates in fewer hands
- Amplifies **labor-radicalization** by 10-18% as working class loses faith in reformist solutions

## Warning Signs

**Early Indicators of Crisis Escalation:**

- **Mass Movement + Political Stalemate** = Protests exceed 3 million participants but zero legislative progress for 18+ months; frustration peaks, movement splits into radical/reformist factions, violence risk increases 30-45%

- **Capital Flight + Regional Recession** = Billionaire assets flee faster than authorities can tax; regional economy enters recession (GDP growth negative 1-3%), unemployment rises 2-4%, triggering broader economic crisis

- **Media Dominance + Polarization** = Billionaire-owned media controls >40% of political discourse; partisan polarization exceeds 65-point divergence, democratic institutions paralyzed

- **International Tax Coordination Failure + Sanctuary Jurisdictions** = No multilateral treaty achieved; billionaires consolidate wealth in 5-8 tax havens, wealth inequality rebounds to 0.75+ Gini, movement credibility collapses

- **Wealth Tax Implementation + Corporate Exodus** = Successful taxation triggers mass corporate relocation (>25% of Fortune 500 companies relocate HQ); investment drought and unemployment spike 3-5%, backlash forces law repeal

- **Class Consciousness Peak + State Violence** = Movement radicalization reaches apex; states deploy security forces against protests, deaths/injuries exceed 500+ in single incident, triggering international sanctions and broader revolutionary cascades
