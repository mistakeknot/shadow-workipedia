# Attention Economy Collapse

## Overview

Attention economy collapse describes the systematic degradation of human cognitive capacity through attention-capturing technologies. Platforms optimized to maximize engagement fragment attention into ever-shorter intervals, undermining the capacity for deep thought, sustained work, and democratic deliberation.
The attention economy extracts value by capturing and fragmenting human focus, but this extraction has negative externalities: reduced productivity, democratic dysfunction, educational failure, and widespread cognitive exhaustion. The economic model is inherently self-limiting as it destroys the cognitive substrate it depends on.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Cognitive Exhaustion Epidemic**: Sustained attention fragmentation produces widespread cognitive fatigue. Productivity metrics decline across knowledge work sectors as workers struggle to sustain focus.
- **Deep Work Extinction**: The capacity for sustained concentration becomes rare. Complex problem-solving, creative work, and long-form reading become impossible for growing populations.
- **Democratic Attention Failure**: Citizens lack cognitive bandwidth to engage with policy complexity. Democratic deliberation collapses into reaction to manufactured outrage and tribal signaling.
- **Education Attention Crisis**: Students cannot sustain attention for traditional learning. Educational outcomes decline as institutions struggle to adapt pedagogy to fragmented attention spans.
- **Attention Restoration Movement**: Counter-movements emerge promoting attention hygiene, digital sabbaths, and cognitive restoration practices. Some jurisdictions regulate attention-capturing algorithms.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Attention Fragmentation** → **Productivity Crisis**: Knowledge economy depends on sustained cognitive effort. Systematic attention degradation undermines economic output and innovation.
- **Focus Loss** → **Democratic Dysfunction**: Complex policy requires citizen attention. Attention-depleted electorates choose leaders based on entertainment value and tribal identity.
- **Cognition Decline** → **Manipulation Vulnerability**: Populations unable to sustain critical attention become vulnerable to propaganda, scams, and demagogic manipulation.
- **Educational Failure** → **Human Capital Collapse**: Next generation raised on attention-fragmenting media lacks cognitive infrastructure for complex work, research, or governance.

## Warning Signs

- Average attention span metrics declining in longitudinal studies
- Book reading rates collapsing across demographics
- Productivity growth stagnating despite technological investment
- Rising rates of ADHD diagnosis across all age groups
- Political discourse shortening to soundbites and memes
- Educational assessment scores declining despite increased resources
- Workers reporting inability to focus during business hours
