# Physical Infrastructure Decay Cascade

## Overview

Physical infrastructure decay cascade describes the growing risk of catastrophic failures in bridges, dams, tunnels, water systems, and other physical infrastructure due to decades of deferred maintenance. Much critical infrastructure in developed nations was built mid-20th century and is approaching or exceeding design lifespan.
Deferred maintenance creates a vicious cycle: skipped repairs accelerate decay, increasing future costs. Climate change compounds the problem by stressing infrastructure with conditions beyond design parameters. The political economy favors visible new projects over invisible maintenance, ensuring the backlog grows until failures force crisis response.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Major Bridge Collapse**: A heavily-used bridge fails catastrophically, causing casualties and triggering emergency inspections nationwide revealing widespread deficiencies.
- **Dam Failure Flood**: An aging dam fails during extreme weather, flooding downstream communities and demonstrating climate-infrastructure interaction risks.
- **Tunnel System Emergency**: Critical tunnel infrastructure (transit, water, vehicle) requires emergency closure for safety, disrupting regional transportation and commerce.
- **Water Main Break Cascade**: Aging water infrastructure experiences accelerating failures, causing service disruptions, sinkholes, and contamination events.
- **Infrastructure Emergency Declaration**: Government declares infrastructure emergency, unlocking emergency funding but revealing the scale of deferred maintenance.
- **Infrastructure Triage Debate**: Limited resources force explicit decisions about which infrastructure to maintain and which to abandon, creating regional conflicts.
- **Private Infrastructure Retreat**: Private operators exit infrastructure contracts as maintenance costs exceed returns, forcing public takeover of degraded assets.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Deferred Maintenance** -> **Accelerating Decay**: Skipping maintenance saves money short-term but accelerates deterioration. Repair costs compound faster than inflation; eventually replacement becomes the only option.
- **Climate Stress** -> **Design Exceedance**: Infrastructure designed for historical climate faces floods, heat, and storms beyond design parameters. Failure rates increase even without additional aging.
- **Collapse Event** -> **Inspection Surge**: A visible failure triggers emergency inspections revealing widespread problems. The political response creates short-term action but rarely sustained investment.
- **Resource Constraints** -> **Triage Politics**: When everything cannot be maintained, explicit choices must be made. Rural vs. urban, rich vs. poor regions compete for limited infrastructure investment.

## Warning Signs

- Infrastructure report cards showing poor or failing grades
- Bridge and dam inspection backlogs growing
- Deferred maintenance liabilities exceeding annual budgets by multiples
- Water main break rates increasing year over year
- Transit systems implementing slow orders due to track conditions
- Emergency repairs consuming capital budgets meant for improvements
- Insurance costs for infrastructure rising or coverage withdrawing
- Climate events causing more infrastructure failures than historical averages
- Engineers warning about specific structures requiring immediate attention
- Private infrastructure operators seeking contract renegotiation or exit
