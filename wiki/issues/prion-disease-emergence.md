# Prion Disease Emergence

## Overview

Prion disease emergence describes the potential for new or spreading prion-based diseases to affect human populations. Prions are misfolded proteins that cause invariably fatal neurodegenerative diseases with no treatment and incubation periods potentially spanning decades.
Chronic wasting disease in deer populations is spreading across North America with unknown spillover potential to humans. Factory farming practices that concentrated BSE risk continue in modified form. Synthetic biology creates new pathways for prion engineering. A prion outbreak would combine the terror of an incurable disease with the uncertainty of long incubation periods and invisible contamination.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Chronic Wasting Disease Spillover**: Chronic wasting disease in deer populations mutates to infect humans through consumption of contaminated meat. Cases appear across hunting communities.
- **Novel Prion Strain Emergence**: A new prion variant emerges with shorter incubation period or different transmission route. Traditional BSE-era containment measures prove insufficient.
- **Food Supply Contamination**: Prion contamination enters industrial meat or supplement supply chains. Potentially millions exposed before detection, facing years of uncertainty about infection status.
- **Healthcare System Overwhelm**: Prion diseases are uniformly fatal with no treatment. Healthcare systems face caring for large populations with incurable degenerative neurological disease.
- **Agricultural Transformation Forced**: Fear of prion transmission forces radical changes to animal agriculture. Factory farming practices implicated in prion spread face regulatory or consumer rejection.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Food Contamination** → **Agricultural Collapse**: Prion-contaminated meat supply triggers collapse of consumer confidence. Animal agriculture faces existential transformation or elimination.
- **Incurable Disease** → **Healthcare Crisis**: No treatment exists for prion diseases. Healthcare systems face providing palliative care to potentially large affected populations.
- **Long Incubation** → **Anxiety Epidemic**: Prions can incubate for decades. Potentially exposed populations face years of uncertainty about whether they carry fatal brain disease.
- **BSE Parallel** → **Trade Disruption**: Countries impose strict import bans on potentially contaminated products, disrupting agricultural trade and food security.

## Warning Signs

- Chronic wasting disease prevalence increasing in wild deer populations
- CWD spreading to new geographic areas and species
- Sporadic CJD cases appearing in younger demographics
- Industrial animal feeding practices creating prion accumulation risk
- Research identifying new prion strains or transmission pathways
- Surveillance systems detecting unusual neurological disease clusters
- Synthetic biology enabling prion engineering capabilities
