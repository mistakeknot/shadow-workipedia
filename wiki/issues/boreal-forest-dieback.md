# Boreal Forest Dieback

## Overview

Boreal forest dieback describes the risk that the world's largest terrestrial biome—the northern forests spanning Canada, Russia, and Scandinavia—transitions from carbon sink to carbon source. Boreal forests store more carbon than tropical forests, making their fate critical to climate trajectories.
Rising temperatures extend fire seasons, enable pest outbreaks, and interact with permafrost thaw to stress these ecosystems. Unlike tropical deforestation driven by human clearing, boreal dieback is primarily climate-driven and may represent an approaching tipping point where forests cannot recover even if temperatures stabilize, locking in accelerated warming.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Boreal Megafire Season**: Record-breaking fire season burns millions of hectares of boreal forest, releasing decades of stored carbon in weeks.
- **Pest Outbreak Expansion**: Warming allows bark beetles and other pests to expand into previously protected boreal zones, causing mass tree mortality.
- **Carbon Sink Reversal Confirmed**: Monitoring confirms boreal forests have shifted from net carbon sink to net source, accelerating climate feedback.
- **Permafrost Forest Collapse**: Thawing permafrost destabilizes root systems, causing widespread "drunken forest" collapse and ecosystem transition.
- **Timber Industry Disruption**: Fire, pest, and dieback losses devastate forestry economies in Canada, Russia, and Scandinavia.
- **Boreal Tundra Transition**: Northern boreal zones convert to tundra or grassland faster than southern expansion, causing net forest loss.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Warming** -> **Fire/Pest Increase**: Higher temperatures extend fire seasons and allow pest ranges to expand northward. Both kill trees faster than regeneration can replace them.
- **Tree Death** -> **Carbon Release**: Dead and burning trees release stored carbon. Boreal forests store more carbon than tropical forests; their loss accelerates warming.
- **Permafrost Interaction** -> **Compound Feedback**: Forest loss exposes permafrost to warming; permafrost thaw destabilizes remaining forests. The two feedbacks amplify each other.
- **Biome Shift** -> **Albedo Change**: Replacing dark forest with lighter tundra or snow changes surface reflectivity, but the transition period of dead trees may absorb more heat, worsening warming.

## Warning Signs

- Boreal fire seasons breaking records multiple years consecutively
- Bark beetle outbreaks expanding into previously unaffected areas
- Satellite monitoring showing declining forest health indices
- Tree mortality rates exceeding regeneration across large areas
- Permafrost-related forest disturbance (drunken forests) increasing
- Smoke from boreal fires affecting air quality in distant cities
- Northern tree line advancement slower than southern forest loss
- Carbon flux measurements showing reduced or reversed sink capacity
- Indigenous communities reporting unprecedented ecosystem changes
- Forestry companies writing down timber assets due to fire/pest losses
