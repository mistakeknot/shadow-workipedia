# Corporate Power Consolidation

## Overview

Market competition erodes as mega-corporations merge and expand, creating oligopolies that control supply chains, pricing, and innovation. Regulatory agencies become captured by the industries they're supposed to oversee, antitrust enforcement collapses, and "too big to fail" financial institutions hold governments hostage. Market concentration reaches dangerous levels where a handful of firms dictate terms to suppliers, consumers, and democracies.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Market Competition**: Decreases as mergers consolidate power and barriers to entry rise
- **Regulatory Independence**: Declines through regulatory capture, lobbying influence, and revolving doors between industry and government
- **Consumer Choice**: Shrinks as dominant platforms and monopolies eliminate alternatives
- **Innovation Rate**: Slows as incumbent monopolies suppress disruptive competitors and stifle startup ecosystems
- **Democratic Influence**: Weakens as corporate lobbying power exceeds voter influence on policy
- **Monopoly Pricing Power**: Increases as firms gain freedom to raise prices without competitive pressure
- **Corporate Profit Margins**: Expand as barriers to entry prevent competition and capture rents from consumers

**Event Types:**
1. **Mega-Merger Approval**: Antitrust authorities fail to block massive consolidation deal, reducing competition in critical sector
2. **Antitrust Lawsuit**: Government sues dominant firm for anticompetitive practices but lawsuit stalls in courts for years
3. **Regulatory Capture Exposure**: Investigation reveals regulators staffed by industry insiders who block enforcement
4. **Platform Monopoly Ruling**: Tech giant ruled illegal monopolist but continues operations during multi-year appeals
5. **Corporate Lobbying Scandal**: Leaked documents reveal massive corporate influence over legislative process; public outrage follows
6. **Market Exclusion Tactic**: Dominant firm uses exclusive deals or bundling to prevent competitors from reaching customers
7. **Patent Thicket Strategy**: Corporation accumulates patents to block innovation in strategic sectors

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Wealth Inequality Explosion** as monopoly profits concentrate with corporate shareholders and executives
- Accelerates **Democratic Backsliding** as corporate power exceeds voter power and corrupts electoral systems
- Exacerbates **Gig Economy Serfdom** as platform monopolies grow and dictate terms to workers with no alternatives
- Worsens **Media Trust Collapse** as monopoly ownership consolidates press and reduces editorial diversity
- Can lead to **Populist Revolt** as citizens demand breaking up big corporations through radical policy shifts
- Creates **Innovation Stagnation** as R&D spending shifts from breakthrough research to patent defense

## Warning Signs

- Market Share Concentration Rising + Merger Activity Accelerating = Antitrust enforcement failure
- Lobbying Spending Increasing + Regulatory Revolving Door Active = Capture in progress
- Consumer Prices Rising + Real Wages Stagnant = Monopoly pricing power exercised
- New Competitor Failure Rate Rising + VC Funding Concentrated = Market barriers hardening
- Stock Buyback Programs Massive + Wage Growth Minimal = Profits flowing to shareholders, not workers
- Patent Litigations Rising + Startup Founding Declining = Patent thickets blocking innovation
