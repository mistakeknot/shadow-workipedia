# Seed Monopolies

## Overview

The consolidation of the global seed industry into the hands of four corporations—Bayer-Monsanto, Corteva, ChemChina-Syngenta, and BASF—represents one of the most consequential but underappreciated concentration of power in human food systems. These companies control over 60% of the global seed market and 70% of agrochemical markets, giving them unprecedented leverage over farmers, food production, and agricultural research. The vertical integration of seeds and chemicals creates lock-in effects where farmers must purchase both from the same company, while intellectual property laws prevent seed saving, forcing annual repurchase of patented varieties.

The consolidation operates through multiple mechanisms: patents on plant genes and traits, terminator technology that renders seeds sterile, licensing agreements that prohibit saving and replanting, aggressive legal enforcement against farmers who inadvertently grow patented plants, and market power to set prices for both seeds and required chemicals. The shift from open-pollinated varieties to hybrid and GMO seeds eliminates farmer autonomy, as saved hybrid seeds don't breed true and GMO seeds are legally protected from replication. Research and development increasingly focuses on varieties that maximize chemical inputs rather than resilience, nutrition, or local adaptation.

The consequences cascade through global food systems: farmers become dependent on corporations for annual inputs, traditional varieties disappear as commercial seeds dominate, genetic diversity collapses creating vulnerability to pests and climate change, food sovereignty erodes as nations lose control over seed supplies, and seed costs consume increasing shares of farm revenue. The power dynamics shift fundamentally—farmers who historically controlled their own reproduction inputs become buyers in monopolized markets, while corporations gain life-or-death control over food production at the genetic level.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects
- **Market Concentration** (Seeds): 60-70%
- **Farmer Autonomy**: -40 to -60
- **Seed Costs**: +30 to +50
- **Genetic Diversity** (Crops): -35 to -55
- **Food Sovereignty**: -25 to -45
- **Agricultural Resilience**: -20 to -35
- **Innovation** (Public Sector Breeding): -30 to -50

### Cascading Effects
- Traditional crop varieties extinct within generation
- Farmers forced to purchase seeds annually
- Seed costs rise faster than crop prices
- Regional adaptation breeding ceases
- Nutrition declines (varieties bred for yield, not quality)
- Chemical dependency increases (seeds designed for specific herbicides/pesticides)
- Food system vulnerability to single-point failures increases
- Developing nations lose food sovereignty
- Peasant farmers displaced by industrial agriculture
- Corporate control over food system becomes entrenched

## Warning Signs

**Early Indicators**:
- Seed industry consolidates to fewer than 6 major players
- Patents on plant genes proliferate
- Seed saving becomes legally restricted
- Traditional varieties availability declines
- Seed prices rise faster than crop commodity prices
- Public sector plant breeding budgets cut

**Critical Triggers**:
- Industry consolidates to 3 or fewer companies
- Terminator technology approved for commercial use
- Major crop (corn, soy, wheat) 80%+ controlled by single company
- Seed saving criminalized in major agricultural nations
- Public seed banks defunded or eliminated
- Antitrust enforcement fails to block mega-mergers
- Farmers' seed saving rights legally eliminated
- Climate stress reveals genetic vulnerability of commercial varieties
