# Nuclear Proliferation Cascade

## Overview

Nuclear Proliferation Cascade describes the accelerating spread of nuclear weapons capability across state and non-state actors, triggered by erosion of non-proliferation frameworks, regional security crises, and technological diffusion. As the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) loses legitimacy and traditional security guarantees weaken, nations pursue nuclear weapons as strategic insurance, creating self-reinforcing regional arms races and dramatically increasing the risk of nuclear use through miscalculation, accident, or terrorism. This creates an existential threat to global stability through the exponential increase in points of failure and decision-makers with nuclear arsenals.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Global Security Index**: Rapidly declines as nuclear breakout declarations occur; cascades downward with each new nuclear state added. Creates negative feedback loop where instability begets more proliferation.
- **Treaty Legitimacy**: Erodes with NPT violations and withdrawal announcements; directly enables acceleration of latency state programs. Treaty credibility collapse opens floodgates for covert programs.
- **Regional Stability Index**: Becomes deeply fragmented; nuclear-capable neighbors create permanent security dilemmas where defensive measures appear offensive to rivals.
- **Arms Race Dynamics**: Enters exponential growth phase; each regional proliferation event triggers 2-3 adjacent states to accelerate weapons programs.
- **Terrorism Risk**: Climbs sharply as material and expertise disperse; correlates with number of nuclear-armed states and political instability within those states.
- **Great Power Trust**: Collapses as nuclear guarantors' credibility questioned and strategic ambiguity increases regarding first-use doctrines.

**Event Types:**

1. **Nuclear Breakout Declaration**: A nation formally announces nuclear weapons capability. Immediately destabilizes its region, triggers neighboring states to accelerate programs, and fractures international coalition responses (UN deadlock, sanctions evasion).

2. **Underground Nuclear Test Detection**: Intelligence agencies detect covert nuclear weapons test. Triggers verification crisis, accelerates weapons miniaturization programs, and forces neighboring states to assume worst-case timelines.

3. **Treaty Withdrawal Announcement**: Nation announces NPT withdrawal and suspension of inspections. Signals intent to weaponize, creates legal cover for covert programs, and triggers domino effect in region.

4. **Security Guarantee Collapse**: Extended nuclear deterrent (e.g., US umbrella over Japan/Korea) loses credibility due to first-use doctrine changes or great power conflict. Immediately activates latency state weapons programs.

5. **Nuclear Material Smuggling Network Dismantled**: Intelligence services interdict major nuclear trafficking route. Temporary setback to proliferation, but drives technology shift toward domestic enrichment/reprocessing.

6. **Regional Proxy Conflict Goes Nuclear**: Sub-state nuclear weapon detonation (dirty bomb or tactical nuke). Shatters nuclear taboo and demonstrates accessibility to non-state actors; initiates global terrorism-proliferation spiral.

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **Great Power Rivalry Redux** when nuclear breakout occurs in contested region—strategic competition accelerates as both sides hedges bets on new nuclear actor's alignment.
- Amplifies **Arms Control Collapse** by rendering verification regimes obsolete; each breakout proves inspection systems inadequate, delegitimizing all arms control frameworks.
- Can lead to **Terrorism Evolution** when nuclear smuggling networks mature or state collapse makes arsenals accessible; low barriers to non-state actors acquiring material.
- Reinforces **Regional Proxy Conflicts** as nuclear weapons become embedded in regional power games; proxy wars escalate in intensity with nuclear backdrop.
- Accelerates **Cyber Warfare Escalation** as states target nuclear command-and-control systems, early warning systems, and weapons facilities to gain asymmetric advantage.

## Warning Signs

- **Diplomatic Isolation + Treaty Skepticism**: Nation withdraws from NPT dialogue while simultaneously expressing doubts about security guarantees—strong signal of imminent breakout.
- **Technology Acquisition + Uranium Enrichment**: Sudden acquisition of dual-use equipment combined with expansion of centrifuge cascades indicates crossing from latency to active weapons program.
- **Regional Instability + Great Power Withdrawal**: One major guarantor reduces military presence while regional tensions escalate—latency state perceives window of vulnerability.
- **Failed Inspection Regime + Intelligence Gaps**: IAEA unable to verify locations of military sites plus growing divergence between public estimates and classified assessments—hidden programs likely expanding.
- **Faction Dominance in Nuclear Command**: Hardline nationalist or military faction gains control of nuclear decision-making authority while civilian oversight weakens—signals reduced threshold for use.
- **Neighboring State Acceleration**: Region-wide cluster of weapons programs activating simultaneously indicates security dilemma spiral has begun; cascade point approaching.
- **Terrorism Incident + Proliferation Network Arrest**: Nuclear material smuggling attempt coupled with attack using WMD precursors suggests convergence of proliferation and terrorism vectors.
