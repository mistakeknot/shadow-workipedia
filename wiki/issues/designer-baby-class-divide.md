# Designer Baby Class Divide

## Overview

Advances in genetic screening, embryo selection, and potential gene editing technologies create the specter of a biological class divide where wealthy families purchase genetic advantages for their offspring while economic barriers prevent lower-income families from accessing the same enhancements. Already, preimplantation genetic diagnosis allows prospective parents to screen embryos for disease risks, select for desired traits, and increasingly identify polygenic attributes like intelligence or athletic potential. As these technologies become more sophisticated and comprehensive, they threaten to transform economic inequality into heritable biological inequality that compounds across generations.

The mechanism operates through expanding reproductive technology options available only to those who can afford them. In vitro fertilization with comprehensive genetic screening costs tens of thousands of dollars, placing it beyond reach of median-income families. Future enhancements—whether selecting embryos with advantageous polygenic scores or direct gene editing—will likely debut at even higher price points accessible only to the affluent. The result is a genetic arms race among elites while the majority faces biological disadvantage in addition to existing economic, educational, and social capital disparities.

This emerging divide poses existential challenges to meritocracy and democratic equality. If intelligence, health, physical capabilities, and even personality traits become purchasable advantages for the wealthy, the fiction of equal opportunity collapses entirely. Children of the rich would begin life with compound advantages: superior genetics selected or edited by technology, plus the existing benefits of wealth, nutrition, education, and networks. The potential for this genetic stratification to become self-reinforcing across generations raises specters of biological caste systems incompatible with liberal democratic values.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

- **Genetic Inequality**: Emerging as wealth purchases biological advantages
- **Social Mobility**: Severely compromised by heritable enhancements
- **Education Gaps**: Widened by cognitive enhancement availability
- **Healthcare Inequality**: Deepened as genetics access stratifies
- **Democratic Legitimacy**: Undermined by biological class divergence
- **Ethical Norms**: Challenged by enhancement normalization

### Cascading Effects

Genetic enhancement inequality creates compounding stratification:

- **Cognitive Class Divide**: Intelligence gaps become biological
- **Health Inequality**: Disease resistance purchased by wealthy
- **Athletic Segregation**: Enhanced and natural competitors separate
- **Mate Selection Dynamics**: Genetic status affects relationship formation
- **Democratic Breakdown**: Biological castes replace equal citizenship

## Warning Signs

Early indicators of emerging genetic class divide:

- Embryo screening adoption concentrated among high-income families
- IVF with genetic testing becoming standard among affluent demographics
- Widening performance gaps between economic classes in standardized testing
- Genetic counseling and enhancement becoming wealth-signaling service
- Insurance markets beginning to price genetic risk/advantage
- International clinics offering enhancement services beyond national regulations
- Public discourse shifting from disease prevention to enhancement normalization
