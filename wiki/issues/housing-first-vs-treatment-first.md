# Housing First vs. Treatment First

## Overview

The Housing First vs. Treatment First debate represents a fundamental divergence in homelessness policy approaches that cascades through urban governance, healthcare systems, and public safety infrastructure. Housing First advocates evidence from the 2005 Utah model and subsequent Metro Denver pilot programs showing that providing unconditional permanent housing to chronically homeless individuals with co-occurring disorders reduces overall costs by 40-60% and improves treatment adherence by enabling stable mental health and addiction care delivery. Treatment First adherents argue that prioritizing substance abuse and mental illness remediation before or concurrent with housing creates sustainable pathways, prevents housing failure, and maintains neighborhood stability—positions supported by scattered evidence from mid-2000s programs showing better long-term outcomes in controlled environments.

As of 2025, this policy conflict has become increasingly polarized, with Housing First approaches dominating progressive urban centers (San Francisco, Denver, Portland) while Treatment First frameworks persist in conservative jurisdictions and Congressional appropriations. The evidence base remains contested: Housing First evaluations show dramatic reductions in ER/jail cycling (60-70% decrease in incarceration) and demonstrable cost-effectiveness, but struggle with 20-30% housing stability failure rates among clients with untreated psychosis or active substance use. Treatment First programs show better long-term psychological recovery metrics (40-55% abstinence maintenance) but consistently underperform on housing retention and cycle more clients back through street homelessness (35-45% within 24 months post-discharge).

This policy gridlock consumes $47 billion annually in fragmented spending across HUD, SAMHSA, CMS, and local municipal budgets—often working at cross-purposes. Major cities oscillate between policy approaches as administrations change, creating devastating churning effects where clients exit housing, lose treatment gains, and re-enter crisis cycles. The political economy is particularly intractable because early Housing First successes in Utah have become increasingly difficult to replicate as underlying homelessness is becoming more severe: chronic homelessness duration has increased from average 6-8 years (2005) to 12-18 years (2025), co-occurring disorders have shifted toward more severe psychiatric presentation (psychosis prevalence +40% since 2010), and housing supply constraints have made placement dramatically more difficult.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Homelessness.PolicyFramework**: Determines allocation of treatment vs. housing funding. Housing First: 70-80% to housing/supportive services, 20-30% to treatment. Treatment First: 40-50% housing, 50-60% treatment. Framework switching mid-campaign applies 2-year adjustment penalty while staff retrain and programs reorganize.

- **Housing.Availability**: Housing First requires 8,000-15,000 units per 100k population available in rapid placement programs. Below 5,000 units = strategy failure, cascading placement delays and street returns. Treatment First less sensitive to housing stock but requires 2-3x more institutional beds (1.2-1.8 per 100 homeless) vs. Housing First (0.2-0.4 per 100).

- **Healthcare.TreatmentCapacity**: Treatment First requires intensive psychiatric/addiction beds. Current baseline 0.8 per 100 homeless; Treatment First target 1.5-2.0. Housing First requires mobile/outreach treatment at 0.4-0.6 per 100 with >90% engagement from community-based providers (not institutional). Institutional provider bias means Treatment First easier to scale from traditional healthcare infrastructure.

- **Homelessness.ChronicityDuration**: Housing First outperforms dramatically with shorter average homelessness duration (<8 years). Outcomes degrade 2% per year above 10-year average. Treatment First relatively duration-insensitive but requires compliant client population. Current duration averaging 14-16 years means Housing First strategy becomes increasingly difficult.

- **Homelessness.PsychosisPrevalence**: Housing First failure rate increases 1.2% per percentage point of untreated psychosis prevalence above 15%. Treatment First failure rate increases 0.6% per point above 25%. As psychosis prevalence climbs toward 35-40%, Housing First requires intensive mobile psychiatric support (tripling service costs and overwhelming sparse rural psychiatry).

- **Substance.ActiveDependenceRate**: Treatment First outperforms when active dependency exceeds 75%. Housing First works better below 60% active use. Current rates are 70-75%, creating policy zone of maximum uncertainty and contested evidence.

- **Urban.NIMBYResistance**: Both strategies vulnerable but Housing First faces neighborhood opposition 3x more intensely (visible street interaction + congregate sober housing creates local mobilization). Treatment First benefits from institutional opacity—facilities less visible to voters. NIMBY activation triggers zoning battles, political delays, 12-24 month placement freezes, and escalates client crisis cycling.

**Event Types:**

1. **Housing First Saturation Crisis**: Policy framework fully Housing First + housing stock <6,000 per 100k homeless + psychosis prevalence >35% = shortage of appropriate housing units drives placement queue backlog >18 months. Street population ages in place without housing, co-occurring disorders intensify, mortality risk rises 40-60%. Triggers provider burnout as staff manage intractable placement failures. Cascades into homelessness criminalization if housing failures exceed 25%.

2. **Treatment First Institutional Overflow**: Policy framework Treatment First + institutional treatment capacity exceeds available census + active dependency >70% = mandatory holding periods exceed 6 months, waiting lists exceed 2,000 in metro areas. Program costs increase 200-300% while outcomes decline (clients spend productive recovery window in queue). High recidivism triggers calls for incarceration-based treatment (criminal justice pipeline).

3. **Policy Whipsaw**: Government switches policy framework mid-campaign (Housing First ↔ Treatment First). All funding mechanisms reorient within 18-36 months. NGO providers face program closure and staff reductions. Client populations fall between frameworks—those expecting housing get treatment, vice versa. Outcomes collapse for 3-5 years during transition. Triggers 15-25% increase in street population, 30% decline in program retention, and 2x increase in mortality.

4. **Housing First Neighborhood Rebellion**: Visible street encampments + congregate housing for substance users triggers NIMBY mobilization. City council votes to defund Housing First programs (occurred Portland OR 2023, San Francisco 2024). Clients housed during uptick now face mass eviction as city scales back. Creates political backlash toward "tough on homelessness" criminalizing policies. Amplifies homelessness-criminalization feedback loop.

5. **Treatment First Demand Shock**: Untreated population reaches critical mass (15%+ of metro homeless untreated psychotic) + severe housing shortage = Treatment First becomes default policy. But institutional capacity insufficient for severe cohort. Long-term residential treatment becomes primary intervention (requiring 18-36 months continuity). Costs balloon from $35-50k/person/year (Housing First) to $70-120k/person/year. Provokes budget crises and de facto abandonment of lowest-function cohort to street survival.

6. **Evidence Collision**: Major quasi-experimental study published comparing Housing First vs Treatment First cohorts from same city. If Housing First shows superior cost-effectiveness + outcomes, Treatment First jurisdictions face immediate political pressure to reallocate funds. Triggers implementation scrambles, housing development acceleration, rapid provider retooling. Political disruption peaks when evidence contradicts incumbent leadership ideology (red state adopting Housing First or blue city embracing Treatment First).

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **homelessness-criminalization** when Housing First fails to secure housing placement >25% of cohort; street population remains visible, NIMBY mobilization increases, cities shift to enforcement-based approaches
- Amplifies **mental-health-crisis** by 12-18% through delayed psychiatric care in Treatment First bottlenecks; Housing First isolates patients from peer support networks in scattered housing, increasing depression/isolation risk by 8-12%
- Triggers **opioid-epidemic** escalation when Treatment First creates 6-12 month waiting lists; desperate clients self-medicate to cope with homelessness, driving overdose mortality 2.5-3.5x baseline
- Amplifies **housing-affordability-crisis** through policy feedback: Housing First requires acquisition of market-rate housing (driving up rents for vulnerable populations), while Treatment First neglect of housing means no low-income placement leverage
- Can lead to **healthcare-system-collapse** when untreated mental illness + substance dependency creates frequent ER utilization (15-20 visits per client annually) overwhelming emergency departments
- Feeds **social-services-atrophy** when policy whipsaws cause NGO provider closures and 2-3 consecutive years of staff turnover + program funding instability

## Warning Signs

**Early Indicators of Policy Framework Failure:**

- **Housing Stock Decline + Chronicity Increase** = Housing First framework collides with regional housing shortage; placement wait time exceeds 18 months, clients age into severe comorbidity. Early warning: wait times >6 months, <40% monthly placement rate.

- **Psychosis Prevalence >35% + Institutional Beds <1.2 per 100** = Treatment First demand exceeds institutional capacity; waiting lists exceed 1,000. Both frameworks struggling simultaneously. Crisis: when <15% of eligible clients in active treatment within 60 days.

- **Active Substance Dependency >75% + Policy Framework Housing First** = Housing First placement creates 30%+ failure rate (housing loss within 12 months); chronically relapsing clients cycle through revolving door. Indicator: 3+ housing episodes in 24 months for >20% of cohort.

- **NIMBY Resistance >40% of Council + Housing First Saturation** = Political veto of housing acquisitions halts new placements; queues stall. Catalyzes bifurcation: affluent neighborhoods impose treatment-only rules, limiting Housing First to poor neighborhoods. Triggers gentrification + displacement feedback.

- **Policy Framework Oscillation + Provider Capacity Loss** = Government switches Housing First ↔ Treatment First within 3 years; NGO staff turnover exceeds 40%. Institutional knowledge lost, outcomes fall 25-40%. Indicator: 3+ funding/policy reversals in 5 years = permanent program instability.

- **Treatment Capacity Surge + Housing Placement Failure** = Treatment First expansionism succeeds (new beds, staffing ramps); but housing-insecure post-treatment population has nowhere to go. 60-70% of discharged clients return to street homelessness. Creates revolving door where institutional costs explode while street population remains constant or grows.

- **Mortality Spike + Diverging Policy** = Excess deaths among street homeless (overdose, weather, violence) rise 25%+ annually while policy debate continues without resolution. Signal: when net population change tracking worse than 2% annual attrition from deaths/exits, and <20% housing exits.
