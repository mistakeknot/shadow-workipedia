# Housing Affordability Crisis

Housing affordability has deteriorated from a cyclical economic concern to a structural crisis redefining the American social contract. Median home prices exceed 5-8x median household incomes in major metros, up from the historical norm of 2.5-3.5x, while rents consume 40-50% of incomes for lower-income renters. Homeownership rates for under-35s have collapsed, institutional investors control growing rental stock, and supply constraints driven by zoning, NIMBYism, and construction costs create permanent scarcity.

The mathematics of impossibility are stark: In San Francisco, median home price ($1.4M) requires household income of $350,000+ to afford at 28% debt-to-income ratios. In Austin, Phoenix, and Boise, rapid price appreciation outpaced wage growth by 3-5x from 2019-2023. First-time buyers face 20% down payment requirements totaling $80,000-$200,000 in major markets, insurmountable for families without generational wealth transfers. Rental markets offer no respite: median rents exceed $2,000/month in 50+ metros, while minimum wage workers need 2-3 full-time jobs to afford a one-bedroom apartment.

Institutional investors—private equity firms, REITs, build-to-rent developers—purchased 20-30% of single-family homes in some markets, converting ownership opportunities to permanent rentals. Blackstone, Invitation Homes, and others control 500,000+ single-family rentals, using algorithmic rent-setting to maximize yields. Supply-side constraints compound demand pressures: single-family zoning covers 75% of residential land in major cities, environmental review delays projects 2-5 years, and construction labor/material costs increased 40% since 2020. The crisis entrenches wealth inequality, fractures generational solidarity, and destabilizes local economies dependent on workforce housing.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

- **Housing Affordability (Price-to-Income Ratio)**: -60 to -90 as ratio exceeds 5x
  - Homeownership rates decline, especially for under-35 age cohort
  - Generational wealth gap widens as homeowners accumulate equity, renters do not

- **Wealth Inequality (Ownership Gap)**: +50 to +85 as homeownership stratifies
  - Top 20% own multiple properties, bottom 50% locked out of ownership
  - Racial wealth gap persists via homeownership disparities

- **Social Mobility (First-Time Buyer Access)**: -50 to -80
  - Down payment requirements exceed median household savings
  - Geographic mobility constrained by inability to afford housing in job centers

- **Economy (Consumer Spending)**: -30 to -60 as housing costs crowd out spending
  - Renters spending 40-50% of income on housing reduce retail, services spending
  - "House poor" owners defer maintenance, cut discretionary expenses

- **Political Stability (Housing as Wedge Issue)**: -35 to -65
  - YIMBYs vs. NIMBYs create local political warfare
  - Generational divide as Boomers oppose zoning reform, Millennials/GenZ demand action

- **Infrastructure (Housing Supply)**: -55 to -75 as construction lags demand
  - Single-family zoning, environmental review, fees block new supply
  - Underbuilding of 3-5 million units nationally since 2008

### Cascading Effects

**To Homelessness Crisis**: Evictions from unaffordable rentals, inability to re-enter market, convert housed individuals to homelessness faster than shelter systems can absorb.

**To Wealth Inequality**: Homeownership as primary wealth-building tool becomes inaccessible to lower/middle class, cementing intergenerational wealth gaps and creating hereditary landlord class.

**To Generational Divide**: Boomers/GenX benefited from affordable housing, oppose upzoning that would reduce their home values; Millennials/GenZ demand reform, fueling age-based political polarization.

**To Geographic Polarization**: Housing costs drive exodus from expensive metros to lower-cost regions, but migration strains infrastructure, locals resent newcomers, political realignment follows.

**To Economic Stagnation**: Consumer spending declines as housing costs consume 40-50% of incomes, businesses struggle to recruit workers who can't afford local housing, productivity declines.

**From Financialization**: Private equity, REITs, build-to-rent developers treat housing as yield-generating asset class, prioritizing investor returns over affordability, removing homeownership opportunities from market.
