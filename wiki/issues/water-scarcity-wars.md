# Water Scarcity Wars

## Overview

As freshwater scarcity intensifies globally, corporations and governments battle for control of water resources. What was once a public good becomes a commodity, triggering conflicts ranging from legal disputes to armed confrontations. Communities face displacement, price gouging, and loss of traditional water rights.

## Background

### Historical Context

Water privatization accelerated in the 1990s under structural adjustment programs from international financial institutions. Early cases in Bolivia (Cochabamba Water War, 2000) and South Africa showed the devastating impact on poor communities when water services were privatized without adequate safeguards.

By the 2020s, climate change had intensified water scarcity, making water rights increasingly valuable and contested. Corporate consolidation in the water sector created powerful entities controlling vast water resources across multiple countries.

### Current State

**Key Developments:**
- 2 billion people live in water-stressed regions
- Private water companies control 10% of global water supply (growing)
- Water futures trading began in 2020, treating water as a financial commodity
- International water disputes have tripled since 2010

**Flashpoints:**
- Transboundary river conflicts (Nile, Mekong, Colorado)
- Aquifer extraction battles
- Desalination plant control
- Glacier water rights

## In Shadow Work

### Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Water Access**: Decreases for populations in privatized regions
- **Public Trust**: Sharp decline when privatization occurs
- **Economic Inequality**: Increases as water costs rise
- **Social Stability**: Decreases, can trigger unrest
- **Corporate Power**: Increases significantly

**Event Types:**
1. **Privatization Proposals**: Government considers selling water utilities
2. **Water Shutoffs**: Companies cut service to non-paying customers
3. **Legal Challenges**: Communities sue for water rights
4. **Violent Conflicts**: Armed clashes over water access
5. **International Tensions**: Cross-border water disputes escalate

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Climate Refugee Crisis** when water becomes unaffordable
- Amplifies **Aquifer Depletion** as companies over-extract
- Enables **Corporate Water Monopolies** formation
- Can lead to **Urban Collapse** in affected cities

### Strategic Considerations

**Early Game** (1900-1950):
- Establish strong public water infrastructure
- Enshrine water rights in constitutions
- Resist early privatization pressure

**Mid Game** (1950-2000):
- Monitor corporate influence on water policy
- Build regional water cooperation frameworks
- Invest in water conservation technology

**Late Game** (2000-2050):
- Address climate-driven scarcity proactively
- Regulate water futures markets
- Support community water management

**Warning Signs:**
- Drought + High Corporate Influence = Privatization risk
- Water Privatization + High Inequality = Conflict risk
- Multiple Privatizations + Low Public Trust = Revolution risk

## Real-World Context

### Key Statistics

- **2.2 billion people** lack access to safe drinking water (WHO, 2023)
- **Private water companies** serve ~800 million people globally
- **Water prices** increased 60-100% on average after privatization
- **Cochabamba, Bolivia**: Water rates increased 300% overnight in 2000
- **Manila, Philippines**: Privatization led to connection rate increase from 50% to 90%

### Notable Examples

#### Cochabamba Water War (2000)
Bechtel Corporation's privatization of Cochabamba's water led to massive price hikes (up to 300% for some families). Mass protests erupted, police repression killed multiple protesters, and the government eventually reversed the privatization. Became a symbol of anti-privatization movements worldwide.

#### Detroit Water Shutoffs (2014-present)
After transferring water management to regional authority, Detroit shut off water to 150,000+ residents for non-payment. UN condemned it as human rights violation. Highlighted how even in wealthy countries, water can become inaccessible.

#### Cape Town Day Zero (2018)
Severe drought nearly caused Cape Town to become first major city to run out of water. Private companies offered to supply water at premium prices, sparking debate about water as commodity vs. public good. Crisis averted through conservation, but raised questions about future water allocation.

### Expert Perspectives

> "Water is not a human right. It should have a market value and be traded like any other commodity."
> — Nestlé CEO Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, 2013 (later retracted)

> "The water crisis is not a future scenario. It is happening now. Privatization often makes it worse for the poor while enriching corporations."
> — Maude Barlow, UN Senior Advisor on Water Rights
