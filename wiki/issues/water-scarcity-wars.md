# Water Scarcity Wars

## Overview

As freshwater scarcity intensifies globally, corporations and governments battle for control of water resources. What was once a public good becomes a commodity, triggering conflicts ranging from legal disputes to armed confrontations. Communities face displacement, price gouging, and loss of traditional water rights.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Water Access**: Decreases for populations in privatized regions
- **Public Trust**: Sharp decline when privatization occurs
- **Economic Inequality**: Increases as water costs rise
- **Social Stability**: Decreases, can trigger unrest
- **Corporate Power**: Increases significantly

**Event Types:**
1. **Privatization Proposals**: Government considers selling water utilities to private companies
2. **Water Shutoffs**: Companies cut service to non-paying customers, triggering protests
3. **Legal Challenges**: Communities sue for restoration of water rights
4. **Violent Conflicts**: Armed clashes over water access in scarcity regions
5. **International Tensions**: Cross-border water disputes escalate to diplomatic crises

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Climate Refugee Crisis** when water becomes unaffordable or unavailable
- Amplifies **Aquifer Depletion** as companies over-extract to maximize profits
- Enables **Corporate Water Monopolies** formation through market consolidation
- Can lead to **Urban Collapse** when cities lose affordable water access

## Warning Signs

- Drought + High Corporate Influence = Privatization risk
- Water Privatization + High Inequality = Violent conflict risk
- Multiple Privatizations + Low Public Trust = Revolution risk
