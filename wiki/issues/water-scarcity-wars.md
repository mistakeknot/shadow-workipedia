# Water Scarcity Wars

## Overview

As freshwater scarcity intensifies globally, corporations and governments battle for control of water resources. What was once a public good becomes a commodity, triggering conflicts ranging from legal disputes to armed confrontations. Communities face displacement, price gouging, and loss of traditional water rights.

Water stress begins when availability drops below 1,700 m³ per capita per year. Absolute scarcity occurs below 500 m³ per capita per year. In game terms, privatization becomes likely when a region's Water Availability parameter falls below 60% of baseline while Corporate Influence exceeds 70 points. The Nile Basin, Indus River system, and Colorado River basin serve as historical flashpoints, with over 2.3 billion people currently living in water-stressed regions.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Water Access**: Decreases by 25-40% for populations in privatized regions, with low-income households experiencing 45-60% reduction in access
- **Public Trust**: Sharp decline of -15 to -30 points when privatization occurs, with additional -5 points per subsequent shutoff event
- **Economic Inequality**: Increases by +12-20% as water costs rise from averaging $0.50/m³ (public) to $2.50-4.00/m³ (private)
- **Social Stability**: Decreases by -10 to -25 points depending on severity; drops below 30 trigger civil unrest events
- **Corporate Power**: Increases by +18-35 points significantly in affected regions, with multinational water corporations gaining monopoly control over 40-70% of urban water systems

**Critical Thresholds:**

- **Water Availability < 1,000 m³/capita/year**: Scarcity risk emerges, +30% chance of privatization proposals
- **Corporate Influence > 75 + Water Availability < 800 m³/capita/year**: Privatization becomes 85% likely within 5 years
- **Water Cost > 5% household income**: Triggers shutoff cascade affecting 15-25% of poor households
- **Shutoffs affecting > 10% of population + Public Trust < 40**: 70% chance of violent protests within 2 years

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **Climate Refugee Crisis** when water becomes unaffordable (> 10% household income) or unavailable (< 50 liters/person/day), displacing 2-8 million people per major city affected
- Amplifies **Aquifer Depletion** as companies over-extract to maximize profits, increasing extraction rates by 35-60% above sustainable levels, depleting major aquifers 15-25 years faster
- Enables **Corporate Water Monopolies** formation through market consolidation, with top 3 companies controlling 60-85% of privatized markets within 10-15 years
- Can lead to **Urban Collapse** when cities lose affordable water access, triggering 20-40% population decline over 5-10 years in severely affected metropolitan areas (> 5 million residents)

## Warning Signs

**Privatization Risk Triggers:**
- Drought (Water Availability < 1,200 m³/capita/year) + High Corporate Influence (> 70) = 65% privatization risk within 3 years
- Fiscal Crisis (Government Debt > 85% GDP) + Corporate Lobbying (> 60 points) = 75% privatization risk
- Previous Utility Privatization (electricity, telecommunications) + Water Scarcity (< 1,500 m³/capita/year) = 55% risk of water privatization following same pattern

**Violent Conflict Risk Triggers:**
- Water Privatization Active + High Inequality (Gini > 0.45) + Low Income Access (< 60 liters/person/day) = 70% violent conflict risk within 2 years
- Shutoffs affecting > 15% population + Social Stability < 30 = 85% protest risk, 40% violent escalation
- Water Availability < 500 m³/capita/year + Ethnic Tensions (> 60 points) + Armed Groups Present = 90% armed conflict risk

**Revolution Risk Triggers:**
- Multiple Privatizations (3+ utilities) + Low Public Trust (< 25) + Economic Inequality (Gini > 0.50) = 60% revolution risk within 5 years
- Water Shutoffs + Electricity Shutoffs + Food Price Spikes (> 40% increase) = 80% regime instability risk
- Corporate Water Monopoly (> 75% market share) + Median Water Cost > 15% household income + No Political Alternatives = 70% revolutionary pressure
