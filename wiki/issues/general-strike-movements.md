# General Strike Movements

## Overview

General strikes represent the most potent form of collective labor action—coordinated work stoppages across industries, sectors, or entire economies designed to extract political or economic concessions. Unlike individual sector strikes, general strikes threaten system-level disruption by halting essential services, transportation, and production simultaneously. As wealth inequality reaches historic extremes, union membership rebounds, and workers face synchronous pressures from gig economy fragmentation, housing crises, and wage stagnation, the structural conditions for general strikes intensify.

A general strike functions as an economic and political veto: when millions refuse to work, governments and corporations face immediate cascade effects—hospitals understaffed, supply chains frozen, revenue streams severed. Historical precedent (1946 France, 1968 France, 2019 France) demonstrates that general strikes can force policy reversals on pensions, wages, and labor rights within days. The threat alone—even unexecuted—reshapes political incentives.

Modern platforms amplify organizing capacity while fragmentation threatens unity. Workers coordinating across apps, gig platforms, and traditional sectors face unprecedented communication ability but fractured material interests. A general strike in 2025+ would be structurally different from 20th-century equivalents: partly coordinated through networks, partly emergent from cascading refusals, with higher international coordination potential but deeper ideological fissures (environmental justice vs. job preservation, automation policy disagreements).

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Labor Organizing Capacity**: Increases through successful sector strikes that build cross-sector solidarity; decreases through union defeats, worker repression, or competing ideologies fragmenting movements
- **Strike Frequency and Scale**: Rises with wage stagnation, housing unaffordability, and perceived inequality; constrained by workers' ability to sustain income loss and employer anti-union enforcement
- **Economic Disruption Index**: Spikes dramatically during general strikes (40-60% production loss for critical sectors); baseline increases with pre-strike tension and worker coordination
- **Worker Morale and Solidarity**: Climbs during successful actions; crashes after defeats, creating 5-10 year organizing lulls
- **Government Legitimacy**: Under pressure if general strikes are massive and government perceived as favoring capital; rebounds if swift concessions granted
- **Corporate Bargaining Power**: Temporarily devastated during general strike but recovers unless fundamental concessions granted; employers use breaks to stockpile, relocate, or automate

**Event Types:**

1. **Sector Strike Escalation**: A major industry strike (transportation, healthcare, energy) reaches critical mass and spreads to sympathetic sectors (warehouse workers, postal service); escalation probability increases with public support >60% and unified leadership
2. **General Strike Declaration**: Multiple unions, workers' organizations, or autonomous collectives declare a general strike with specific demands; actual participation varies widely (30-80% of workforce) depending on enforcement capacity and worker resolve
3. **Critical Service Disruption**: Hospitals reduce staffing, ports jam, power distribution falters, supply chains freeze—government declares emergency, triggering either rapid negotiation or military/police deployment
4. **Cross-Border Strike Coordination**: Workers in multiple countries coordinate action (bus drivers EU-wide, dock workers globally), creating systemic pressure that national governments struggle to manage alone
5. **Political Concession or Crackdown**: Either government grants major labor demands (wage floors, pension protection, union recognition) or escalates with arrests, injunctions, strikebreakers, and violence—outcome determines 5-20 year labor landscape
6. **Strike Fund Depletion**: Workers sustain action for weeks but union strike funds exhaust; workers forced to choose between continued action and survival; creates psychological defeat even if partial demands met

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **Labor Power Resurgence** when general strikes succeed in extracting concessions, building worker confidence for future action
- Exacerbates **Gig Economy Exploitation** during strikes when gig workers unable to participate (no strike fund, no job protection) become replacement labor or lose income without collective gains
- Intensifies **Wealth Inequality** tensions when workers see profit margins untouched by strikes, fueling radical demands beyond traditional labor conditions
- Accelerates **Union Decline Reversal** if general strikes demonstrate collective power, or deepens it if strikes crush membership through defeat and blacklisting
- Creates political openings for **Economic Policy Overhaul** if general strikes force government interventions (price controls, wealth taxes, public manufacturing)
- Can trigger **Social Movement Radicalization** when general strikes partially fail—workers lose faith in traditional union leadership and embrace autonomous/anarchist organizing

## Warning Signs

- **Wage Stagnation + Rising Inequality**: Workers maintain/lose purchasing power while CEO pay climbs 15-20% annually = general strike conditions ripening
- **Sector Strike Success + Cross-Sector Solidarity Messaging**: Successful transport or healthcare strike generates public sympathy, other sectors cite precedent = escalation risk within 6-12 months
- **Union Membership Climbing + Political Polarization**: Unions grow while government hostility increases = pressure cooker dynamic, strike as political assertion
- **Housing Costs >40% of Income + Perceived Wage Theft**: Workers see immediate survival pressure + gig economy algorithmic wage cuts = radicalized base demanding systemic change
- **Multiple Sector Strikes Ongoing + No Major Concessions**: 3+ active major strikes without significant wins = frustration accumulates, general strike framed as necessary escalation
- **Strike Fund Building + Organizer Training**: Unions stockpile resources and conduct strike preparedness = deliberate preparation phase, strike within 12-24 months likely
- **International Coordination Messaging + Synchronized Organizing**: Cross-border labor communications, global unions coordinating = potential for unprecedented international general strike
- **Government Anti-Labor Rhetoric + Police Preparation**: Political leaders attack unions, police receive riot training/equipment = both sides signaling escalation preparation
- **Critical Infrastructure Worker Organizing**: Healthcare, energy, transportation, water system workers forming organizing committees = if coordinated, general strike becomes infrastructure threat
- **Gig Worker Unionization Success**: Platform workers winning legal victories on classification = organizing model spreads, harder for employers to fragment labor base
