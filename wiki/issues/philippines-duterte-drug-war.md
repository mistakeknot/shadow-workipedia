# Philippines Duterte Drug War

## Overview

When Rodrigo Duterte assumed the Philippine presidency in June 2016, he launched what would become one of the deadliest drug campaigns in modern history, promising to eliminate drugs from Philippine society within six months. [^britannica-duterte] Estimates of killings linked to the campaign vary widely; Human Rights Watch summarizes a broad range of estimates (from the thousands to the tens of thousands) and documents systemic patterns of police violence and impunity. [^hrw-duterte-drug-war] The vast majority of victims were poor urban residents killed in extrajudicial summary executions by police units and state-sanctioned vigilante groups, often with minimal investigation or evidence. The killings created a culture of impunity where police officers faced virtually no prosecution, despite extensive documentary evidence of unlawful executions. Families were left without recourse or compensation, and the International Criminal Court opened an investigation into alleged crimes against humanity tied to the drug war. [^icc-philippines-drug-war]

The campaign's brutality extended beyond direct killings. Thousands of detentions occurred without proper investigation, torture became a documented policing tactic, and entire communities were surveilled and raided based on informants who received bounties. The collapse of judicial process meant that accused individuals had few protections—many were killed before trial, and those imprisoned rarely received fair proceedings. The social fabric of poor neighborhoods fractured as neighbors informed on neighbors for rewards, as children witnessed police executions in their communities, and as families grappled with both the loss of loved ones and the broader psychological trauma of living in a state-sanctioned killing environment. The drug war's violence also destabilized crime dynamics: instead of eliminating drugs, the campaign created power vacuums filled by more ruthless syndicates, military-linked trafficking networks, and gang violence that continues to plague the nation. Years after the campaign's formal end under President Marcos Jr., the Philippines struggles with the institutional damage, the impunity structures that remain entrenched, the international isolation that resulted from documented human rights abuses, and the fundamental loss of faith in state protection that empowers future authoritarians.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

- **Authority Pressure (+45%)**: State capacity for extrajudicial action increases dramatically; police units operate with expanded mandate and reduced oversight. Public tolerance for emergency measures rises initially before collapsing.
- **Civil Trust (-72%)**: Public confidence in law enforcement, courts, and human rights institutions plummets. Citizens increasingly rely on private security, vigilante justice, and informal conflict resolution rather than state institutions.
- **Institutional Corruption (+58%)**: Police units develop protection rackets tied to drug trade, military commanders extract payment from trafficking operations, and judges can be bribed to either prosecute innocents or dismiss cases against connected criminals.
- **Community Cohesion (-65%)**: Neighborhoods fracture along informant/accused lines; extended family networks break apart; migration accelerates as residents flee high-violence zones; inter-generational trauma manifests in mental health crises.
- **International Standing (-80%)**: Diplomatic isolation from Western allies increases; human rights investigations trigger sanctions and restricted aid; criminal investigations of officials create legal jeopardy for international travel and financial flows.

### Cascading Effects

- **Institutional Decay → Vigilante Proliferation**: As public trust in police collapses, citizens organize private security networks and neighborhood vigilante groups. These groups, lacking legal training or restraint, commit additional killings under the pretense of drug enforcement. The state cannot reclaim monopoly on violence without admitting institutional failure.
- **Trauma Accumulation → Psychological Crisis**: Children who witness parental execution, spouses who discover partners murdered by police, parents who lose children to state violence experience compounding PTSD and grief. Mental health services are inadequate; substance abuse increases; suicide rates spike among affected families.
- **Drug Market Consolidation → Organized Crime Expansion**: Dead small dealers and users do not eliminate the market; instead, major trafficking organizations consolidate territory, expand into neighboring countries, and corrupt larger portions of the security apparatus. Military units and Chinese syndicates fill power vacuums.
- **Impunity Normalization → Authoritarian Deepening**: Each unpunished extrajudicial killing establishes a precedent. When police execute without consequence, the boundary between lawful state action and state violence dissolves. Subsequent authoritarian escalation (political opponent arrests, media suppression, election fraud) faces less resistance because institutional checks have already collapsed.
- **Economic Contraction → Migration Crisis**: Entire economic sectors (informal trade, market vendors, day labor in affected neighborhoods) contract due to violence. Residents unable to support families migrate internally to other cities or leave the country entirely, reducing remittances, destabilizing sending communities, and creating diaspora that becomes vector for future political instability.

## Warning Signs

- **Public Health Announcements Frame Drug Use as Existential Threat**: Political leaders begin describing drug consumption and petty trafficking as threats to national security rather than public health issues. Language shifts from "treatment" to "elimination." Weaponized statistics (false body counts, inflated drug seizures) dominate public discourse.
- **Police Autonomy Expands Without Oversight Mechanisms**: Government grants expanded arrest authority without corresponding judicial review, independent investigation units, or mandatory reporting requirements. Police budgets increase while oversight budgets stagnate. Internal affairs units are staffed by fellow officers.
- **Initial High-Profile Executions Lack Criminal Investigation**: When well-documented killings occur, prosecutions fail to materialize or proceed superficially. Perpetrators remain on active duty. Media reporting on the killings becomes dangerous (journalists face threats or prosecution).
- **Informant Networks Proliferate with Financial Incentives**: Government announces bounties or rewards for drug-related tips. Anonymous informant systems lack verification mechanisms. Accusations based on grudges or financial disputes result in raids and killings without corroboration.
- **Human Rights Documentation Meets State Harassment**: Human rights groups begin documenting killings; state response includes filing criminal cases against human rights lawyers, threatening family members, or revoking organizational licenses. International attention is met with nationalist rhetoric about "defending sovereignty."
- **Drug War Serves as Pretext for Political Consolidation**: Killings disproportionately target political opponents or constituencies that oppose the regime. Opposition figures are accused of drug ties without evidence. The campaign accelerates around election cycles.
