# Energy Transition Chaos

## Overview

The rapid shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy creates cascading economic disruptions: stranded fossil assets lose trillions in value, grid instability emerges from renewable intermittency, and the transition's uneven pace leaves millions in energy poverty while petro-states face economic collapse. The gap between promised green jobs and actual employment exacerbates inequality, triggering geopolitical instability and infrastructure failures across interconnected energy systems.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Energy Security**: Increased renewable dependency creates vulnerability windows when wind/solar production drops; successful grid modernization buffers this effect; petro-state collapse can trigger supply shocks
- **Grid Stability**: Intermittent renewables destabilize traditional grids; battery storage and smart grid tech gradually mitigate; extreme weather events spike volatility during transition periods
- **Fossil Asset Value**: Linear decline as markets price in transition; accelerates during crises; stranded asset writedowns trigger financial system stress
- **Green Job Creation**: Lags actual transition pace; regional disparities create unemployment pockets; mismatch between job locations and displaced workers amplifies social friction
- **Energy Affordability**: Rising for bottom quartile due to infrastructure investment costs; falling for top quartile with household renewables; energy poverty spikes when grids destabilize

**Event Types:**

1. **Grid Blackout Crisis**: Cascading failures during peak renewable variability + aging infrastructure. Triggers supply chain delays for repairs, energy poverty spike, regional economic slowdown.

2. **Stranded Asset Writedown**: Major coal/gas utility or fossil fuel company faces insolvency. Ripples through pension funds, regional economies dependent on fossil employment, and triggers investor panic.

3. **Green Investment Surge**: Market conditions favor renewable projects; creates construction jobs and tech demand. Temporarily masks underlying employment mismatches; can trigger asset bubbles in green tech.

4. **Petro-State Crisis**: Major oil/gas exporter (Russia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria) faces revenue collapse. Triggers civil unrest, geopolitical instability, and refugee outflows; cascades into climate-refugee-floods.

5. **Energy Poverty Spike**: Infrastructure costs and affordability gaps leave millions without reliable energy access. Linked to health crises, reduced productivity, and social unrest in vulnerable regions.

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **Rare-Earth-Element Squeeze** when renewable buildout accelerates (rare earths needed for batteries, turbines, solar panels)
- Triggers **Infrastructure Decay** when aging fossil fuel infrastructure (pipelines, power plants, refineries) becomes stranded without reinvestment
- Triggers **Supply-Chain Fragility** when grid instability disrupts manufacturing of renewable components and battery supply chains
- Triggers **Climate-Refugee-Floods** when petro-state collapse combines with energy poverty to destabilize regions already vulnerable to climate impacts

## Warning Signs

**Pre-Crisis Indicators:**

- Energy Security < 35 AND Grid Stability < 40 = Imminent blackout risk
- Fossil Asset Value declining > 15% annually AND Green Job Creation growth < 5% = Stranded asset cascade likely
- Energy Affordability (bottom quartile) < 30 AND Regional unemployment > 12% = Energy poverty tipping point
- Petro-state revenue decline > 40% in single year AND Political stability < 50 = Geopolitical crisis window opening

**Feedback Loops:**

- Grid instability reduces investor confidence in energy transition
- Energy poverty increases social pressure against climate policies, slowing transition progress
- Stranded assets depress regional economies, reducing tax revenue for grid modernization
- Petro-state collapse accelerates refugee outflows, increasing climate-refugee-floods pressure
