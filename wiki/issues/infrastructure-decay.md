# Infrastructure Decay

## Overview

Aging infrastructure systems—bridges, dams, power grids, water systems, and transportation networks—face accelerating deterioration due to deferred maintenance, insufficient funding, and increasing climate stress. Political short-termism and budget constraints perpetuate a cycle of reactive crisis management rather than preventive investment, creating cascading risks across the economy, public safety, and climate resilience.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Infrastructure Reliability**: Declines as maintenance backlog grows; drops sharply after major failure incidents. Improves with infrastructure investment policies.
- **Economic Productivity**: Reduced by infrastructure failures (supply chain disruptions, transportation delays). Recovery requires significant capital investment.
- **Public Safety**: Directly threatened by aging bridge and dam failures, electrical grid failures, and water system contamination incidents.
- **Maintenance Backlog**: Increases annually with deferred maintenance; accelerates during economic downturns when funding is cut. Decreases only through sustained infrastructure spending.
- **Climate Resilience**: Aging infrastructure is more vulnerable to extreme weather, flooding, and heat stress. Each climate event worsens decay without adaptation investments.

**Event Types:**
1. **Major Failure Incident**: Random infrastructure failure (probability increases with high decay/low reliability). Minor economic impact but triggers public concern.
2. **Dam or Bridge Collapse**: High-severity event (5% probability annually if reliability <20%). Causes significant economic disruption, casualties, and political crisis.
3. **Power Grid Failure**: Rolling blackouts or regional outages. Disrupts economy, increases public safety risks, and may trigger insurance/financial sector cascades.
4. **Water System Contamination**: Aging pipes leak contaminants. Health crisis event, triggers economic costs (bottled water, medical expenses), increases public concern.
5. **Infrastructure Bill Passage**: Political event (triggered by high public concern or after major failure). Invests capital to reduce maintenance backlog and increase reliability.
6. **Infrastructure Bill Failure**: Political event (low public concern or political gridlock). Maintains status quo; decay accelerates if already high.

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Supply Chain Fragility** when infrastructure failures disrupt transportation networks or port operations.
- Triggers **Cyber Warfare Escalation** when critical infrastructure vulnerabilities are exposed and exploited.
- Triggers **Climate Insurance Collapse** when catastrophic infrastructure failures exceed insurance capacity.
- Contributes to **Housing Impossibility Crisis** when building codes tighten due to aging structural systems or when infrastructure costs inflate housing expenses.
- Worsens with **Climate Change**: Extreme weather events accelerate decay, creating feedback loops (more failures → more public safety risks → higher pressure for expensive emergency repairs).

## Warning Signs

- **High Maintenance Backlog + Low Government Funding** = Increasing failure probability
- **Recent Major Failure + Low Public Concern** = Likely political gridlock preventing preventive investment
- **Aging Infrastructure Stock (>50 years) + Economic Recession** = Cascading failures likely within 2-5 years
- **Climate-Vulnerable Region + Aging Infrastructure + Rising Temperatures** = Accelerated decay; multiple simultaneous failures possible
- **Low Infrastructure Reliability + High Economic Interdependence** = Supply chain disruption risk
