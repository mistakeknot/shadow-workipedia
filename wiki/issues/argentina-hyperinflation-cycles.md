# Argentina Hyperinflation Cycles

## Overview

Argentina experiences recurring hyperinflation cycles driven by fiscal deficits, central bank money-printing, and lost policy credibility. Since 2018, the peso has collapsed from ~18 per USD to 1,000+ (2024), with inflation reaching 211% annually (2023) and 189% (2024). Each crisis follows a pattern: political pressure forces monetary expansion to fund spending, currency loses value, imports become unaffordable, price spirals accelerate, and IMF bailouts impose austerity that triggers political backlash. President Javier Milei's 2024 dollarization strategy (eliminating the peso) represents an extreme response to institutional failure. Without fiscal discipline and central bank autonomy, Argentina risks permanent currency dysfunction and sustained poverty increases affecting 55% of the population.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Currency Stability Index**: Argentina's peso experiences monthly devaluation spirals (3-8% per month) when fiscal deficit exceeds 4% of GDP. Milei's dollarization reduces monthly volatility to 0.2% but eliminates monetary policy flexibility and caps economic growth to 1-2% annually. Peso collapse triggers 18-25% import price increases within 3 months.

- **Inflation Rate**: When central bank money supply growth exceeds 15% annually (coupled with 5%+ fiscal deficits), inflation accelerates in quarters 2-4, reaching 25-35% quarterly rates. Each successive crisis generates higher baseline inflation (ratchet effect): 1990 peak 200%, 2001 peak 450%, 2018 peak 210%, 2023 peak 211%. Political pressure on central bank to monetize spending creates lag of 2-3 quarters before inflation becomes visible in prices.

- **Real Wages & Employment**: Inflation erodes nominal wages by 8-15% in real terms when wage indexation lags price acceleration. Manufacturing employment declines 2-4% as imported input costs surge. Unemployment rises 1.5-3 percentage points within 6-12 months of peso collapse. Poverty increases 2-5 percentage points as lower-income households lack hedging strategies.

- **IMF Bailout Cycles**: IMF programs trigger 6-12 month recession (GDP contraction 1.5-3%) due to austerity conditions. Bailouts provide 6-18 months of currency stabilization but require spending cuts that provoke 8-15 point polarization increases. Political opposition to austerity historically triggers early program abandonment (2001-2002) or default (2001).

- **Political Instability Index**: Inflation exceeding 30% annually increases political polarization by 12-18 points and reduces government approval 4-6 points per 20% inflation. Central bank governor replacement accelerates when inflation exceeds 40% annually (historical average 2.1 governors per 3-year crisis cycle).

**Event Types:**

1. **Fiscal Deficit Spike**: Budget deficit exceeds 4% of GDP (triggered by election-year spending or commodity collapse). Central bank comes under political pressure to monetize 40-60% of deficit. Lag of 2-3 quarters before inflation peaks. Severity increases with successive crises due to lost credibility.

2. **Currency Collapse Episode**: Peso loses >15% of value in single month (cascade triggers if >25% monthly). Import prices spike immediately; exporters profit but manufacturing input costs surge. Triggers capital flight, dollar hoarding, and informal dollarization (40-60% of transactions shift to USD in severe episodes). Real wages fall 5-8% in affected quarter.

3. **IMF Program Entry**: Government accepts IMF bailout with austerity conditions. Triggers 2-4 quarters of GDP contraction (1.5-3% each quarter). Creates political crisis: austerity polarizes population 15-20 points, fractures ruling coalition, often forces early elections or program abandonment within 12-24 months.

4. **Wage-Price Spiral**: Inflation reaches 50%+ quarterly; workers demand wage indexation; businesses raise prices to offset; wage increases fuel further price increases. Self-reinforcing cycle accelerates inflation 10-20 percentage points monthly until central bank tightens (rare due to political pressure) or currency crashes (causing reset to cycle start).

5. **Dollarization Threshold**: Government or Central Bank announces currency replacement or abandonment of monetary policy (e.g., Milei's 2024 dollarization bill). Eliminates currency-collapse scenarios but locks economy into rigid exchange rate. Creates 1-2 year adjustment recession but permanently removes inflation trigger mechanism. Reduces policy flexibility: growth capped at 1.5-2.5% annually without peso devaluation for competitiveness.

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **emerging-market-debt-crises** when external debt reaches 80%+ of GDP + local currency collapses; foreign creditors demand 15-25% haircuts; reserves deplete in 4-6 months absent bailout
- Amplifies **currency-devaluation-spirals** by 20-30% through contagion: peso collapse signals regional currency risk, affecting neighboring economies (Uruguay, Paraguay) and triggering capital flight across LatAm
- Triggers **political-instability-contagion** when approval ratings collapse <30% + austerity required; polarization exceeds 20 points, often forcing early elections and coalition fracturing
- Amplifies **central-bank-credibility-collapse** by 25-40%: repeated defaults (2001) and central bank politicization destroy inflation expectations anchoring; even with credible policy, inflation premium persists 5-10 years
- Triggers **poverty-crisis** when real wages decline >10% + inflation erodes savings; poverty increases 5-10 percentage points within 18-24 months; inequality (Gini) rises 2-4 points

## Warning Signs

**Early Indicators of Hyperinflation Cycle Escalation:**

- **Fiscal Deficit + Election Year** = Budget deficit >3.5% coincides with presidential or legislative elections; political pressure to spend increases; central bank receives monetization requests exceeding 50% of deficit, creating 3-4 quarter inflation lag before crisis peaks at 150%+

- **Peso Weakness + Capital Flight** = Currency depreciation reaches 5%+ monthly; dollar deposits increase 8-12% monthly; informal dollarization exceeds 50% of transactions; signals imminent formal currency crisis within 2-4 quarters

- **IMF Program Entry + Political Opposition** = New IMF bailout imposed; ruling coalition fragmentation exceeds 15 points; street protests mobilize 100k+ people opposing austerity; historical precedent: program abandonment occurs within 18-24 months in 60% of Argentine crises

- **Wage Indexation Demands + Inflation Acceleration** = Inflation reaches 40%+ quarterly; unions demand wage indexation matching inflation; wage-price spiral mechanism engages; without central bank rate shock, inflation accelerates additional 20-30 percentage points per quarter

- **External Reserves Depletion + Debt Service Pressure** = Central bank reserves fall <$10 billion (3 months import coverage); debt service payments exceed 40% of government revenues; country approaching insolvency within 6-12 months absent new financing

- **Central Bank Governor Replacement + Policy Reversals** = Third central bank appointment within 24 months signals institutional collapse; new governor reverses predecessor's policy (e.g., tightening abandoned for monetary expansion), destroying credibility; inflation expectations unanchor, rising 5-8 percentage points

- **Dollarization Announcement + Economic Rigidity** = Government announces or implements official dollarization (Milei precedent 2024); eliminates currency adjustment mechanism but forces 18-36 month recession; exporters lose competitiveness, unemployment rises 3-5 points; political backlash emerges 12-18 months post-implementation
