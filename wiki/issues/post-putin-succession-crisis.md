# Post-Putin Succession Crisis

## Overview

The eventual transition from Vladimir Putin's extended rule in Russia presents unprecedented risks for global stability. With no clear successor, deeply entrenched power structures, and competing factions within the security services and oligarchy, Russia faces potential instability at a scale unseen since the Soviet collapse. The concentration of power in a personalist regime means that Putin's departure—whether through death, incapacitation, or political defeat—could trigger a chaotic succession struggle with global ramifications.

The stakes extend far beyond Russia's borders. As a nuclear superpower with vast energy resources, significant military capabilities, and ongoing conflicts, a destabilized Russia could trigger regional conflicts, nuclear security concerns, energy market disruptions, and mass migration. The lack of institutional mechanisms for peaceful power transfer in an increasingly personalized authoritarian system creates a dangerous power vacuum scenario.

Historical precedents from the Soviet collapse, the Yugoslav wars, and other post-authoritarian transitions suggest that succession crises in nuclear-armed states carry catastrophic risks. The integration of Russia's economy with global energy markets, its military interventions in multiple theaters, and its nuclear arsenal make this potential crisis a first-order global security concern.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects
- **Political Stability**: -40 to -60 during succession crisis
- **Military Readiness**: Variable (-30 to +20 depending on faction control)
- **Energy Security** (Global): -25 to -40 from market disruption
- **Nuclear Security**: -50 to -70 (command and control concerns)
- **Economic Growth** (Russia): -15 to -35
- **Civil Liberties**: -20 to +30 (depends on successor regime type)
- **Regional Stability** (Eastern Europe/Central Asia): -30 to -50

### Cascading Effects
- Energy price spikes trigger global recession
- NATO-Russia tensions escalate during power vacuum
- China moves to secure influence over weakened Russia
- Internal ethnic conflicts resurrect in Caucasus, Tatarstan
- Nuclear weapons security protocols break down
- Cyber warfare intensifies as factions seek leverage
- Post-Soviet states face intervention or destabilization
- Arctic territorial disputes accelerate

## Warning Signs

**Early Indicators**:
- Putin health rumors and extended absences from public view
- Purges of security service leadership or oligarchs
- Unusual military mobilizations or leadership changes
- Constitutional amendments attempting to establish succession
- Increased repression of potential political rivals

**Critical Triggers**:
- Putin sudden death or incapacitation
- Open conflict between FSB and military factions
- Regional governors declaring autonomy
- Mass capital flight and ruble collapse
- Nuclear weapons facilities security incidents
- Major defections of military commanders
- Ethnic violence in border regions
- International recognition of competing claims to power
