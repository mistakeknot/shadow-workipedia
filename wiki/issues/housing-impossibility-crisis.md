# Housing Impossibility Crisis

## Overview

When median home prices reach 7-10× median income (historically 3×), shelter transforms from a consumption good into a speculative asset. Zoning codes grant incumbent homeowners veto power over new construction while institutional investors buy housing stock for capital appreciation rather than occupancy. This creates a political economy where the median voter benefits from artificial scarcity while renters—particularly younger generations—are systematically locked out of homeownership, producing tent cities, mass squatting, and generational wealth stratification.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Housing Affordability Index**: Decreases sharply when price-to-income ratio exceeds 10×; triggers crisis state at 20× ratio
- **Generational Wealth Gap**: Widens as boomers accumulate equity while millennials/Gen Z remain renters; compounds with each year
- **Public Anger**: Rises when median rent exceeds 50% of median income; accelerates when evictions spike
- **Political Polarization**: Increases as homeowners vote NIMBY while renters demand density; creates intractable municipal gridlock
- **Social Mobility**: Declines as inability to build equity locks families into rental class across generations

**Event Types:**
1. **The Great Squat**: 100,000+ occupy vacant investor-owned units when vacancy rates exceed affordability thresholds
2. **Landlord Lynching**: Mob justice spreads as eviction moratoriums end and mass displacement begins
3. **Tent City Siege**: Police attempt to clear encampments; violent clashes and national media attention
4. **Arson Wave**: "If I can't live here, no one will" attacks on luxury developments and vacant units
5. **NIMBY Recall Election**: Pro-density city council members face coordinated homeowner backlash

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Tent City Proliferation** when housed population cannot afford rent; camps grow exponentially
- Amplifies **Homelessness Criminalization** by creating political pressure for "sweeps" as encampments spread
- Can lead to **Housing Bubble and Foreclosure Crisis** in circumstances where speculation overtakes fundamentals
- Creates pressure for **Gentrification Displacement** as investors seek "undervalued" neighborhoods to flip
- Reinforces **Racial Reckoning Cycles** through redlining legacy and discriminatory lending patterns
- Escalates to **Property War** when organized squatting movements clash with police eviction units

## Warning Signs

- Price-to-Income Ratio > 10× + Institutional Ownership > 30% = Speculation Bubble
- Rent Burden > 50% + Eviction Rate Rising = Mass Displacement Imminent
- Vacancy Rate > 15% + Homelessness Rising = Artificial Scarcity Crisis
- NIMBY Zoning Victories + Pro-Density Election Losses = Political Gridlock Lock-In
