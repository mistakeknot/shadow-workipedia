# Housing Impossibility Crisis

## Overview

When median home prices reach 7-10× median income (historically 3×), shelter transforms from a consumption good into a speculative asset. In major metros, this manifests as $800,000 median home prices against $85,000 median household incomes—a 9.4× ratio that prices out 73% of prospective first-time buyers. Zoning codes grant incumbent homeowners veto power over new construction while institutional investors control 30-45% of single-family rental stock in Sun Belt markets, buying housing for capital appreciation (8-12% annual) rather than occupancy. This creates a political economy where the median voter (age 58, homeowner since 1992) benefits from artificial scarcity while renters—particularly millennials and Gen Z—are systematically locked out of homeownership, producing tent cities, mass squatting, and generational wealth stratification.

The crisis is structural: the U.S. faces a 3.8 million unit shortage nationally, growing by 400,000 units annually as construction permits (1.4M/year) lag household formation (1.8M/year). Meanwhile, 15 million housing units sit vacant—11% of total stock—held by investors waiting for appreciation, creating artificial scarcity even in surplus conditions.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Housing Affordability Index**: Decreases by -3 points per year when price-to-income ratio exceeds 7×; -8 points/year at 10×; triggers crisis state at 20× ratio (median home $1.6M vs $80K income). Each point decrease reduces homeownership rate by 0.7% and increases rent-burdened households by 1.2%.
- **Generational Wealth Gap**: Widens by $120,000/year as boomers (78% homeownership, $280K average equity) accumulate 6-9% annual appreciation while millennials/Gen Z (42% homeownership) remain renters paying $1,850/month median rent. Gap compounds exponentially: $400K differential at age 35 becomes $1.2M by age 55.
- **Public Anger**: Rises +4 points when median rent exceeds 40% of median income (threshold: $2,100 rent vs $5,250 income); accelerates +12 points when rent burden hits 50% ($2,625 rent vs $5,250 income). Eviction spikes (>4% annual eviction rate) add +6 points per quarter.
- **Political Polarization**: Increases +2 points per NIMBY zoning victory (defeats of 50+ unit developments); +5 points when homeowner turnout exceeds renter turnout by >20 points in municipal elections. Creates intractable gridlock when polarization >75 (homeowners 82% pro-restriction, renters 71% pro-density).
- **Social Mobility**: Declines -1.5 points/year as inability to build equity locks families into rental class. Homeownership drops from 64% national average to 38% for under-40s, reducing intergenerational wealth transfer by $180K per family over 30 years.

**Event Types:**

1. **Rent Strike Cascade** (Public Anger >60, Rent Burden >45%)
   - Trigger: Median rent hits $2,400 while median income stagnates at $5,100/month; 380,000 households in city spend >50% income on rent
   - Event: Tenant unions coordinate 35,000-unit rent strike demanding 20% reduction and eviction moratorium
   - Outcomes: Landlords lose $42M/month revenue; banks threaten foreclosure; city council emergency session; 60% success = rent rollback law; 40% failure = mass evictions and Public Anger +15

2. **The Great Squat** (Vacancy Rate >12%, Homelessness >2 per 1,000, Price-to-Income >9×)
   - Trigger: 18,000 vacant investor-owned units sit empty while 23,000 unhoused sleep on streets; activist network maps vacant properties
   - Event: Coordinated action occupies 847 vacant units across 12 neighborhoods on single night; squatters change locks, establish tenant associations
   - Outcomes: Police eviction attempts meet barricades; media coverage shows luxury towers with lights off; 45% = city negotiates acquisition for social housing; 55% = SWAT raids, mass arrests, Political Polarization +18

3. **Landlord Lynching** (Eviction Rate >5%, Public Anger >75)
   - Trigger: Eviction moratorium expires; 14,000 eviction notices filed in 30 days; video of sheriff's deputy throwing elderly woman's belongings goes viral
   - Event: Landlord of 230-unit building arrives for "wellness check" eviction; mob of 400 tenants and neighbors blocks exits; situation escalates to violence
   - Outcomes: National Guard deployment; state declares housing emergency; 70% = eviction pause and rent relief fund; 30% = martial law, Political Polarization +25

4. **Tent City Siege** (Homelessness >4 per 1,000, Public Anger >65)
   - Trigger: Encampment reaches 2,800 residents on public land; businesses demand "cleanup"; mayor orders sweep
   - Event: 300 police in riot gear vs 1,200 residents + 600 protesters; hours-long standoff; tear gas, arrests, injuries; national media descends
   - Outcomes: Federal injunction halts sweep; 55% = city builds sanctioned camps + services; 45% = violent clearance, dispersal to 40+ smaller camps, Social Cohesion -12

5. **Arson Wave** ("If I can't live here, no one will")
   - Trigger: $65M luxury condo tower advertises "$3,500/month studios" in city where median rent is already $2,300 and vacancy rate is 14%; project sits 68% vacant after 18 months
   - Event: Series of 7 fires at vacant luxury developments over 6 weeks; anonymous manifestos cite "housing as weapon"; $180M in damages
   - Outcomes: Insurance rates spike 40%; construction halts; 50% = investigation reveals investor fraud, triggers reform; 50% = crackdown escalates to surveillance state, Civil Liberties -8

6. **NIMBY Recall Election** (Homeowner Turnout - Renter Turnout >25 points)
   - Trigger: City council approves zoning reform allowing 6-story mixed-use on transit corridors; homeowner groups collect 48,000 signatures for recall of 3 pro-density councilors
   - Event: $4.2M recall campaign funded by realtor PACs and homeowner associations; "Save Our Neighborhoods" vs "Yes In My Backyard" battles
   - Outcomes: 65% = recalls succeed, reform repealed, Political Polarization +10, construction drops 35%; 35% = recalls fail, zoning stands, permits increase 60%/year

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Tent City Proliferation** when rent burden >50% pushes 8-12% of marginally housed into homelessness; camps grow exponentially from 400 → 2,800 → 8,500 residents over 18 months as each sweep disperses to 3-5 new locations
- Amplifies **Homelessness Criminalization** by creating political pressure for "sweeps" when encampment visibility reaches threshold (>1,500 residents within 2 miles of downtown); anti-camping ordinances pass when homeowner petition signatures >15,000
- Can lead to **Housing Bubble and Foreclosure Crisis** when speculation overtakes fundamentals: institutional ownership >35%, price appreciation >15%/year for 3+ years, price-to-rent ratio >25 (vs historical 15), triggering 30-40% price crash when interest rates rise 2+ points
- Creates pressure for **Gentrification Displacement** as investors seek "undervalued" neighborhoods with price-to-income <6× to flip; targets historically Black/Latino areas with 40-60% renter populations, displacing 15-25% of longtime residents per year once median rent increases >8%/year
- Reinforces **Racial Reckoning Cycles** through redlining legacy: Black homeownership 44% vs white 74%; home values in formerly redlined areas appraise 23% lower; denial rates for Black mortgage applicants 2.4× white applicants at same income levels
- Escalates to **Property War** when organized squatting movements reach critical mass (>500 occupied units) and clash with police eviction units; triggers when squat success rate >60% (occupiers hold properties >90 days before eviction)

## Warning Signs

**Early Stage (Months 0-18):**
- Price-to-Income Ratio climbs from 5× to 7× over 2 years while wage growth <2%/year
- Institutional investors acquire 400+ single-family homes per quarter (8% annual market share increase)
- First-time buyer share drops below 30% (vs 40% historical average)
- Construction permits decline 15% while population grows 1.2%/year

**Crisis Threshold (Months 18-36):**
- Price-to-Income Ratio >10× + Institutional Ownership >30% = Speculation Bubble (price crash risk 70% within 24 months)
- Rent Burden >50% for 35%+ of renters + Eviction Rate rising >6%/year = Mass Displacement Imminent (tent city formation within 6-12 months)
- Vacancy Rate >15% (2.2M+ vacant units citywide) + Homelessness rising >15%/year (>3 per 1,000) = Artificial Scarcity Crisis (squat movement formation within 9 months)
- NIMBY Zoning Victories (>60% of upzone proposals defeated) + Pro-Density Election Losses (turnout gap >25 points) = Political Gridlock Lock-In (reform impossible for 4-8 years)

**Collapse Conditions (Months 36+):**
- Price-to-Income Ratio >15× triggers exodus (population decline 2-4%/year as workers relocate)
- Rent Burden >60% for >20% of population triggers rent strike cascade (35,000+ units)
- Homelessness >6 per 1,000 + Encampment concentration >2,500 residents triggers siege cycle
- Vacancy Rate >20% + Squat success rate >60% triggers Property War
