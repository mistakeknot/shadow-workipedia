# Post-Growth Economics

The foundational assumption of modern economics - that perpetual GDP growth is necessary and desirable - faces mounting challenges from ecological limits, climate imperatives, and evidence that growth beyond a certain point fails to improve wellbeing. Post-growth economics, including degrowth and steady-state economic theories, proposes radical restructuring of economic systems to prioritize sustainability, equity, and quality of life over expansion. The paradigm confronts the reality that infinite growth on a finite planet is physically impossible, and that the pursuit of growth is driving civilization toward ecological collapse.

The theoretical case for post-growth rests on multiple pillars. Ecological economics demonstrates that GDP growth in wealthy nations increasingly represents throughput of materials and energy rather than genuine improvements in welfare. The Easterlin Paradox shows life satisfaction plateauing beyond moderate income levels while inequality continues to damage wellbeing. Climate science indicates that even "green growth" is likely impossible at the pace required to prevent catastrophic warming. Resource depletion, biodiversity collapse, and pollution suggest humanity has exceeded planetary boundaries, yet economic policy remains fixated on growth metrics that incentivize further transgression.

The political and cultural obstacles to post-growth economics are formidable. Entire systems of employment, investment, government revenue, and social stability depend on growth assumptions. Financial markets require returns that depend on expansion. Government debt serviceability assumes growing tax bases. Pension systems need growing worker-to-retiree ratios. The suggestion that growth should be deliberately slowed or reversed triggers accusations of condemning the poor to permanent poverty. Yet the alternative - pursuing impossible growth until ecological systems collapse - may leave no viable economy at all. Post-growth economics represents the confrontation between ecological reality and economic mythology.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

**Economic Growth Rate**: -100% (paradigm shift away from growth)
**Environmental Sustainability**: +18% (reduced throughput and extraction)
**Social Wellbeing**: +12% (focus on quality of life vs. GDP)
**Economic Inequality**: -15% (distribution prioritized over growth)
**Political Stability**: -12% (transition challenges, resistance)
**Employment Structure**: -8% (work reorganization required)
**Climate Change Mitigation**: +14% (emissions reduction through contraction)

### Cascading Effects

Ecological limits recognized → Growth paradigm questioned → Post-growth theories gain traction → Policy experiments attempted → Growth-dependent systems challenged → Political resistance intensifies → Either transition to sustainable economics or ecological collapse forces change

## Warning Signs

- GDP growth decoupling from wellbeing indicators increasingly clear
- Climate targets impossible under continued growth scenarios
- Resource depletion accelerating despite efficiency improvements
- Inequality worsening despite economic expansion
- Ecological overshoot metrics showing persistent transgression of boundaries
- Wellbeing plateauing or declining in wealthy nations despite growth
- Green growth promises repeatedly failing to materialize
- Post-growth economics moving from fringe to mainstream discourse
- Pilot programs for work reduction and basic income emerging
- Financial system fragility increasing with growth dependency
- Political movements challenging growth ideology gaining support
- Academic consensus building that perpetual growth is impossible
