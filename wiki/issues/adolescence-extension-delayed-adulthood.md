# Adolescence Extension & Delayed Adulthood

## Overview

Adolescence extension describes an economic-and-cultural failure mode where the transition into stable adulthood is delayed for large cohorts. When education debt, credential inflation, and housing costs rise faster than wages, young adults remain in a prolonged limbo: dependent, risk-averse, and unable to accumulate assets or start families on historical timelines.
The macro effect is a feedback loop: delayed household formation reduces fertility and mobility, which increases demographic stress and intensifies intergenerational distribution conflicts.

## Game Mechanics

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Precarity** -> **Delayed Milestones**: Housing, job instability, and debt delay household formation, career consolidation, and fertility decisions.
- **Delayed Independence** -> **Intergenerational Conflict**: Prolonged dependency reshapes family bargaining, political priorities, and social trust.

## Warning Signs

- Median age of leaving home and first-child rising across multiple regions
- Youth underemployment and credential requirements increasing in parallel
- Household formation rates diverging from population growth and housing supply
