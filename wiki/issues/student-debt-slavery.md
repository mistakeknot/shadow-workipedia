# Student Debt Slavery

## Overview

Non-dischargeable student loans create lifetime debt servitude as $1.7 trillion in US debt burdens 45 million borrowers, with income-driven repayment plans capitalizing interest so balances grow despite payments. When a $30k loan becomes $80k owed after 10 years of on-time payments, and degrees become worthless faster than debt can be repaid, the system transforms education from opportunity into trap. This reverses generational wealth transfer, delays family formation, and concentrates despair in precisely the cohort that needs agency to build the future.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Student Debt Burden** (`education.studentDebtBurden`): Increases 5-8%/year from tuition inflation outpacing general inflation; spikes when Pell Grant coverage collapses (79% → 29% tuition coverage); compounds through negative amortization when income-based payments fall below interest charges
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio** (`education.debtToIncomeRatio`): Crisis threshold at >2.0× when average debt ($30k+) exceeds starting salary; triggers when AI job displacement reduces credentialed job availability; worsens as for-profit institutions charge $15-50k/year with 40% default rates
- **Homeownership Rate** (`economy.homeownershipRate`): Drops -40 percentage points at age 30 (Millennials vs Boomers) as debt delays home buying; $50k debt = 5-year delay in marriage + homeownership; reinforces housing crisis as potential buyers are locked out
- **Fertility Rate** (`population.fertilityRate`): Decreases -0.5 children per $50k debt burden; explains 15-20% of TFR collapse from 2.1 (2007) to 1.64 (2023); creates demographic death spiral feedback as fewer children → higher per-capita tax burden → more debt needed
- **Financial Stress Index** (`society.financialStressIndex`): Rises from debt burden >10% of income, PSLF denial rate (98% → 30%), and wage garnishment (1.1M borrowers); at >0.85 triggers debt-related despair and suicide risk; mass suicide events ("Suicide Graduation") when stress >0.85 + despair >0.70

**Event Types:**
1. **University Burning**: Debtor movement strength >0.7 + generational resentment >0.75 → graduates torch campus when Biden forgiveness rejection channels rage into direct action
2. **Suicide Graduation**: Financial stress >0.85 + despair >0.70 → mass suicide event as 5,000-6,500 annual debt-related deaths concentrate in ceremonial protest (medical/law school debt carries 4-5× baseline suicide risk)
3. **Boomer Hunting**: Generational resentment >0.75 + cost ratio >12× → intergenerational violence when Gen Z pays 15× what Boomers paid for devalued degrees
4. **Debt Strike Wave**: Movement strength 0.4 → 0.7 after Supreme Court rejection → 500k+ borrowers refuse payment in coordinated default (Corinthian Colleges 2015 model at scale)
5. **PSLF Denial Backlash**: 98% denial rate (2017-2019) on Public Service Loan Forgiveness → mass protests as teachers/nurses discover technical disqualification after 10 years of payments

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **AI Job Displacement** when degrees become worthless as AI replaces credentialed workers, leaving borrowers with debt but no means of repayment (reinforcing feedback: $30k debt + $0 job = permanent servitude)
- Amplifies **Housing Impossibility Crisis** by removing 40% of potential homebuyers at age 30, concentrating demand pressure on rental markets while supply stagnates
- Can lead to **Gig Economy Serfdom** in extreme cases where debt forces acceptance of any platform work ($50k debt + no full-time options = algorithmic management submission)
- Creates pressure for **Billionaire Abolition Movement** when generational wealth transfer reverses (median student owes $30k to lenders while median billionaire gains $100M/year), making wealth inequality visceral and personal rather than abstract

## Warning Signs

- Debt-to-Income >2.0× + AI Job Displacement >0.4 = Credential Worthlessness Trap
- Tuition Inflation 5-8%/year + Pell Grant Coverage <30% = Debt Accumulation Spiral
- PSLF Denial Rate >50% + Financial Stress >0.70 = Institutional Betrayal Crisis
- Homeownership Gap >35 points + Fertility Rate <1.7 = Generational Reproduction Failure
