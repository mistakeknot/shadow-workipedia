# Tax Haven Hemorrhage

## Overview

The systematic erosion of government tax revenues through corporate profit shifting and wealthy individual evasion represents a critical challenge to public finance sustainability. As multinational corporations and high-net-worth individuals exploit jurisdictional arbitrage, developing and developed nations alike struggle to fund essential services, creating a race-to-the-bottom dynamic in tax policy.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Government Revenue**: Decreases as more corporations shift profits offshore; effects accelerate with each competing tax cut
- **Public Service Funding**: Directly correlates to revenue loss; healthcare, education, and infrastructure suffer with delays
- **Wealth Inequality**: Widens as wealthy individuals access tax havens while middle class bears increasing burden
- **Corporate Accountability**: Weakens as opacity increases; tax avoidance becomes normalized corporate strategy
- **International Cooperation**: Deteriorates as countries compete for corporate headquarters and capital; global minimum tax agreements face resistance

**Event Types:**
1. **Leaked Documents Scandal**: Exposure of hidden offshore accounts (Panama Papers, Paradise Papers style) creates political pressure but fleeting enforcement windows
2. **Global Minimum Tax Agreement**: International coordinated effort to establish baseline corporate tax rates; creates temporary cooperation boost but faces implementation challenges
3. **Corporate Inversion Wave**: Spike in corporations relocating headquarters to low-tax jurisdictions; triggers immediate revenue loss and retaliatory measures
4. **Whistleblower Revelation**: Bank employee or tax professional exposes systematic evasion schemes; increases public concern and regulatory attention
5. **Tax Haven Blacklisting**: International organizations or powerful nations impose sanctions on non-compliant jurisdictions; creates disruption and financial stress

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Sovereign Debt Spiral** when government revenue loss forces increased borrowing and debt servicing consumes budgets
- Compounds **Infrastructure Decay** as deferred maintenance accelerates from budget constraints
- Accelerates **Healthcare System Collapse** when public health funding becomes unsustainable
- Enables **Democratic Backsliding** as wealthy elites gain disproportionate political influence through tax-funded wealth accumulation

## Warning Signs

- Corporate effective tax rates falling below 10% while statutory rates remain 20%+ = Acceleration phase
- Multiple countries cutting corporate tax rates within 5-year period = Race-to-bottom spiral
- Wealth held in tax havens exceeds 10% of global GDP = Structural instability
- Public concern about fairness + Government revenue declining = Political crisis threshold
- Leaked financial documents + Weak enforcement = Perfect storm conditions
