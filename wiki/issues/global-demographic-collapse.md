# Global Demographic Collapse & Population Implosion Crisis

## Overview

Global demographic collapse describes a structural population transition where low fertility, aging, and rising dependency ratios strain fiscal capacity, labor markets, and care systems. The failure mode is not a single shock but a compounding constraint: fewer working-age people must sustain more retirees, while housing, childcare, and economic precarity suppress births further.
The political pathway runs through distributional conflict (young vs old, natives vs migrants), legitimacy erosion, and policy deadlock as governments attempt to patch gaps with migration, automation, or benefit cuts—each producing backlash and second-order instability.

## Game Mechanics

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Dependency Ratio Surge** -> **Fiscal Stress**: Fewer workers support more retirees, compressing tax bases and expanding entitlement liabilities.
- **Labor Shortages** -> **Inflation & Capacity Limits**: Persistent vacancies raise wages and prices while constraining output and care capacity.

## Warning Signs

- Fertility rates falling below replacement across multiple major regions for a decade
- Median age rising rapidly with shrinking prime-age labor force cohorts
- Pension and healthcare entitlement spending outpacing revenues for consecutive budget cycles
