# Generational Wealth Transfer & Inheritance Wars

## Overview

Generational wealth transfer describes the social and political conflict that emerges when large-scale inheritance becomes a dominant determinant of life outcomes. As asset prices (especially housing) rise faster than wages, access to property and stability becomes increasingly dependent on family transfers, entrenching inequality across cohorts.
The conflict surface includes inheritance and estate-tax politics, intergenerational resentment, legitimacy crises around “merit,” and intensified capture as concentrated wealth reshapes policy and public discourse.

## Game Mechanics

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Asset Concentration** -> **Political Capture**: Inherited wealth increases elite leverage over institutions, media, and policy.
- **Inheritance Tax Conflict** -> **Legitimacy Erosion**: Perceived unfairness drives backlash across age cohorts and classes, intensifying polarization.

## Warning Signs

- Rising share of household wealth held by older cohorts with stalled young-asset ownership
- Escalating political fights over inheritance, property, and capital-gains taxation
- Increasing reliance on family transfers for housing access and business formation
