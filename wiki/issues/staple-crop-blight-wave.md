# Staple Crop Blight Wave

## Overview

A staple crop blight wave is a synchronized surge of plant disease across major cereals (wheat, rice, maize) that cuts yields across multiple breadbaskets within a short span. Climate volatility, genetic bottlenecks in dominant varieties, and trade corridor coupling increase the odds that pathogens can jump regions faster than response capacity scales.

Because staples anchor both calories and political stability, a blight wave quickly becomes an export-control crisis: governments restrict shipments to protect domestic supply, prices spike globally, and importing regions cross famine and unrest thresholds.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Regional Wheat Rust Wave**: A virulent rust strain overwhelms control programs and cuts yields in a season.
- **Rice Blast Corridor Spread**: Disease follows monsoon and trade corridors into new basins.
- **Emergency Export Controls and Corridor Bans**: Exporters impose bans, amplifying panic buying and price spikes.
- **Famine Threshold Crossing**: Multiple importing regions cross relief thresholds as availability drops.
