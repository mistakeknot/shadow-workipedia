# Semiconductor Sovereignty Wars

## Overview

The global semiconductor industry has become the critical node in geopolitical competition, with Taiwan's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) controlling roughly 54% of the world's chip manufacturing capacity. This concentration of fabrication capability in a single island nation that China claims has created an unprecedented vulnerability in the global economy. Modern economies—from defense systems and medical devices to smartphones and automotive control systems—depend entirely on semiconductors. A supply shock in advanced chips could paralyze military operations, disable healthcare infrastructure, halt industrial manufacturing, and bankrupt technology companies within weeks.

China's government has made semiconductor self-sufficiency a national priority, investing hundreds of billions in domestic chip manufacturing through state-owned enterprises and subsidized private companies. However, Western export controls on advanced chip-making equipment (particularly the Dutch ASML extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that are essential for sub-7nm nodes) have slowed progress. The United States, meanwhile, has weaponized semiconductor access through CHIPS Act subsidies for domestic manufacturing and strict export restrictions targeting Chinese companies like Huawei. Japan and South Korea—holding critical positions as suppliers of production equipment and memory chips—find themselves caught between US security demands and economic interdependence with China.

The collision of Taiwan's strategic importance, China's ambitions to reverse "the century of humiliation," US fears of military vulnerability, and the technical impossibility of rapidly duplicating advanced fab capacity has created the most consequential economic chokepoint on Earth. Military scholars warn that Taiwan represents the "Pearl Harbor" scenario of the 21st century: a quick seizure before democratic nations can respond militarily. A Chinese invasion would immediately halt TSMC's production, creating a cascade of military paralysis, economic free fall, and geopolitical power redistribution that no sanction could reverse.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

**Chinese State Investment in Semiconductors** (0-100 scale)
- 0-20: Low priority, limited funding (~$5B/year), TSMC dominance unchallenged
- 20-40: Moderate investment ($20-30B/year), SMIC and Yangtze River Semiconductor gaining capability
- 40-60: Aggressive push ($50-80B/year), domestic production reaches 28nm, threatens mid-range market
- 60-80: Major expansion ($100B+/year), advances toward 14nm, attracts international talent and IP theft
- 80-100: Existential commitment, full state mobilization, achieved 12nm locally, but international isolation triggered

**Effect Chain**: As Chinese capabilities increase, Taiwan's strategic value declines BUT Western security concern increases, raising military tensions. Peaks paradoxically—higher capability = lower Taiwan reliance BUT higher invasion incentive.

**Western Export Control Strictness** (0-100 scale)
- 0-30: Permissive, chip sales to Chinese entities allowed, economic integration continues
- 30-50: Selective restrictions, advanced nodes blocked but mature chips allowed, hybrid supply chains
- 50-70: Broad restrictions, all entities tied to Chinese military blocked, ASML severely restricted
- 70-85: Comprehensive controls, chip architectures require US approval, technology decoupling accelerates
- 85-100: Total blockade, no advanced chips to China, Chinese anger peaks, military posturing intensifies

**Effect Chain**: Stricter controls reduce Chinese capability gains BUT accelerate Chinese militarization and Taiwan invasion probability. Creates feedback loop of mutual technological arms racing.

**Taiwan Manufacturing Resilience** (0-100 scale)
- 0-30: Concentrated in single locations, vulnerable to sabotage/natural disaster, redundancy weak
- 30-50: Distributed across northern/central Taiwan, some backup capacity, moderate redundancy
- 50-70: Geographic dispersion, hidden backup fabs, secure supply lines, resilient to most disruptions
- 70-85: Decentralized nodes operational, distributed manufacturing networks, international partnerships
- 85-100: Fortress production, hardened fabs with autonomous power/cooling, extraction operations in allied nations

**Effect Chain**: Higher resilience increases Taiwan's survival probability but also reduces desperation incentives for Western military support. Creates perverse incentive for intentional vulnerability.

**Global Just-In-Time Dependency** (0-100 scale)
- 0-30: Manufacturing regionalized, 3-6 month component buffers, economies can survive 2-3 month outage
- 30-50: Moderate JIT, 4-8 week buffers, supply chains stretched, 6-12 week outage causes serious disruption
- 50-70: Deep JIT integration, 1-4 week buffers, automotive/aerospace vulnerable, 4-8 week outage = catastrophe
- 70-85: Extreme JIT, hours-to-days of inventory, single fab disruption cascades instantly across industries
- 85-100: Ultra-lean supply chains, real-time pull-based manufacturing, any disruption = immediate paralysis

**Effect Chain**: Higher JIT increases economic damage from supply shock but also increases political pressure to prevent disruption. Nations holding buffer stocks are advantaged.

### Cascading Effects

**Supply Chain Fragmentation & Regional Blocs** (Triggered by strict export controls)
- Western alliance (US/EU/Japan/South Korea/Taiwan) builds interconnected supply networks
- Chinese bloc (China/Russia/Iran/North Korea) develops parallel ecosystem using older node chips
- Neutral nations squeezed to choose sides or develop hybrid strategies
- **Economic**: Duplication of fabs reduces efficiency but increases resilience for each bloc
- **Timeline**: 5-8 years to establish parallel production; costs hundreds of billions in subsidies
- **Result**: Two competing semiconductor ecosystems with incompatible standards, higher prices for both

**Automation Equipment Shortage & Bottleneck Cascades** (Triggered by simultaneous fab construction)
- ASML, Applied Materials, Lam Research cannot fulfill simultaneous orders from US, Taiwan, allied nations
- **Consequence**: Fabs delayed 2-4 years, original construction timelines slip, competitive position shifts
- **Secondary Effect**: Equipment suppliers become geopolitical chokepoints; governments pressure allocation
- **Tertiary**: Smaller nations' projects cancelled; supply chain concentrates further in major powers
- **Result**: "Choke point moves" from Taiwan fabs to equipment makers, then to raw materials (rare earths)

**Chip Technology Stagnation & Performance Plateau** (Triggered by decoupling and sanctions)
- Chinese ban on advanced node imports + trade war = slower innovation in both blocs
- **Consequence**: 14nm-and-older nodes stabilize, Moore's Law falters, AI/quantum computing delayed
- **Economic**: Lower-performance chips insufficient for emerging applications (autonomous vehicles, advanced AI)
- **Social**: Developing nations fall further behind, unable to access cutting-edge processors
- **Military**: Both sides' AI/cyber capabilities plateau, destabilizing balance of power

**Taiwan Crisis Hostage Dynamics** (Triggered by severe supply disruption + geopolitical escalation)
- Western nations economically dependent on Taiwan (chips) while militarily committed to defending it
- China leverages this asymmetry: threatened invasion increases chip prices, demonstrating Taiwan's value
- **Consequence**: "Hostage economics"—Taiwan uses supply threats to extract military/economic concessions
- **Geopolitical**: Creates perverse incentives for Taiwan to *increase* supply concentration rather than diversify
- **Result**: Deadlock where Taiwan's security depends on others' economic desperation, unstable equilibrium

**Semiconductor Nationalism & Geopolitical Weaponization** (Triggered by supply disruptions + tech competition)
- Nations mandate "trusted" chip suppliers with security verification, increasing complexity/cost
- Supply becomes politicized; sales decisions made by governments, not markets
- **Consequence**: Loss of price competition, quality pressure, innovation incentives for established players
- **Economic**: Chip prices rise 20-40% across markets; smaller fab nations excluded from trusted lists
- **Social**: Xenophobic hiring policies, brain drain reversal (talent avoids affected nations)
- **Result**: Permanent shift to state-mediated semiconductor markets, end of free trade era

## Warning Signs

**Taiwan Strait Military Exercises Increase in Frequency & Scale**
- Historical baseline: 1-2 major Chinese exercises yearly (2010-2020)
- Early warning: 4-6 exercises yearly with increased troop counts and duration
- Critical threshold: Monthly exercises with 100,000+ troops, live-fire drills crossing median line
- **Indicator**: Watch PLA naval deployment notices, Taiwan foreign ministry statements, ADIZ incursion frequency

**TSMC Production Bottlenecks & Capacity Constraints**
- Indicators: Chip manufacturers report 12+ month lead times (normal = 6-8 weeks)
- Extreme constraint: TSMC operating at 110-120% capacity with lottery systems for allocation
- **Warning**: Demand outpacing supply by 20%+ despite price increases
- **Source**: Semiconductor Industry Association quarterly reports, individual fab guidance, component distributor data

**Chinese Domestic Fab Breakthroughs & Capability Announcements**
- Indicators: SMIC announces new node achievement (14nm, 12nm, 7nm) with public celebrations
- Verification challenge: Chinese claims often inflated; compare with leaked test results, reverse engineering
- **Critical**: If China achieves indigenous 7nm+ with >1000 wafer-per-month capacity, reduces Taiwan leverage
- **Source**: IC Insights, TrendForce, SemiEngineering, leaked equipment manifests

**Western Export Control Escalation Cycles**
- Indicators: US Commerce Department adds new companies to Entity List quarterly
- Acceleration: New restrictions on specific materials (photoresists, rare earths), design tools, personnel
- **Threshold**: Restrictions on ASML sales, EDA software embargoes, Taiwan equipment movement limits
- **Source**: US BIS announcements, ASML investor calls, Taiwan government statements

**Geopolitical Statements Emphasizing Semiconductor Autonomy**
- Indicators: Political leaders publicly discuss "chip security" as national emergency
- Escalation: Public funding announcements for domestic fab construction, "reshoring" initiatives
- **Red flags**: Military planners describing chip shortages as existential threat, contingency planning leaked
- **Source**: Congressional testimony, DARPA announcements, allied nation defense white papers

**Taiwan Diaspora Evacuation Planning & Contingency Discussions**
- Indicators: TSMC executives interviewed about "unthinkable scenarios," contingency site preparations
- Escalation: Insurance companies repricing Taiwan-related risks, evacuation insurance sales increase
- **Critical**: TSMC announcing subsidiary fabs as operational redundancy (already underway in US/Japan)
- **Source**: Business press profiles, insurance market data, corporate 10-K filings

**Raw Material Supply Disruptions in Chip Production Pipeline**
- Indicators: Shortages of neon gas (Ukraine supply), tungsten (China dominance), rare earth elements
- Cascading: Taiwan/South Korea report production delays due to material scarcity
- **Amplifier**: Each material shortage forces buffer stockpiling, reducing manufacturing flexibility
- **Source**: US Geological Survey, industry consultant reports, fab production guidance updates
