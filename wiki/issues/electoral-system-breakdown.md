# Electoral System Breakdown

## Overview

The electoral system breakdown represents a cascading failure of democratic institutions responsible for conducting fair, transparent, and universally accepted elections. This crisis encompasses voter suppression tactics, gerrymandering, election denial movements, foreign interference operations, campaign finance corruption, and critical vulnerabilities in voting infrastructure—all combining to erode public confidence in electoral legitimacy and democratic governance itself.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Electoral Legitimacy**: Decays rapidly when voting infrastructure is compromised, results are disputed, or large portions of the electorate feel excluded. Recovers slowly through transparent audits and successful reforms.
- **Voter Participation**: Drops sharply in regions with active suppression campaigns or where elections are perceived as rigged. Swing voters flee to political extremes when faith in institutions collapses.
- **Political Violence Risk**: Escalates dramatically when election results are contested. Militias mobilize, street violence increases, and extremist groups gain recruitment momentum.
- **Democratic Stability**: Declines proportionally to the number of concurrent electoral vulnerabilities. System becomes brittle when multiple failure points exist simultaneously.
- **International Standing**: Erodes as other democracies question governance legitimacy. Trade partners and allies reassess political risk.

**Event Types:**
1. **Contested Election Crisis**: A major election's results are disputed by losing candidates or foreign actors. Triggers emergency response mechanisms and heightened political violence risk.
2. **Voter Suppression Scandal**: Media exposes systematic suppression campaigns (purged voter rolls, ID requirements targeting minorities, limited polling locations in opposition strongholds). Public trust drops sharply.
3. **Election Infrastructure Attack**: Cyberattack on voting systems, registration databases, or ballot counting infrastructure. May not change results but destroys confidence in system integrity.
4. **Campaign Finance Ruling**: Court decision dramatically loosening or restricting political spending. Shifts power toward wealthy donors or incumbent parties depending on ruling direction.
5. **Electoral Reform Passage**: Major reform to voting systems, redistricting rules, or ballot access requirements. Can either strengthen or further undermine legitimacy depending on implementation.

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Democratic Backsliding** when Electoral Legitimacy falls below 35% and remains suppressed for multiple years.
- Exacerbates **Disinformation Plague** through election-focused misinformation campaigns that accelerate erosion of trust.
- Combines with **Cyber-Warfare Escalation** when foreign actors conduct sophisticated interference operations targeting electoral processes.
- Amplified by **Surveillance State Creep** when governments use election security as justification for expanding monitoring of political opponents.

## Warning Signs

- **Election credibility + vocal election denial = Institutional crisis**: When significant political figures publicly dispute election integrity AND public faith in results falls below 50%, contested elections become inevitable.

- **Voter suppression evidence + weakened courts = Normalized exclusion**: When suppression tactics are documented AND judicial constraints prevent remedy, electoral participation becomes increasingly skewed.

- **Voting infrastructure vulnerabilities + coordinated foreign interference = Outcome uncertainty**: When systems lack adequate cybersecurity AND hostile nation-states conduct documented interference operations, the legitimacy of results comes under question.

- **Partisan gerrymandering + campaign finance imbalance = Locked-in control**: When district boundaries favor one party AND wealthy donors dominate political spending, the electoral playing field becomes so tilted that competitive elections disappear.

- **Rising political violence + election-related tensions = Escalation threshold**: When street violence is already elevated AND major elections approach with disputed legitimacy, violence can spike dramatically in campaign season.
