# Accessibility Compliance Failure

## Overview

Thirty-five years after the Americans with Disabilities Act, accessibility remains aspirational rather than achieved. Physical barriers persist—missing curb cuts, inaccessible transit, buildings with entrance-only ramps—while digital exclusion accelerates as websites, apps, and services ignore WCAG standards. Enforcement mechanisms lack resources, penalties fail to deter violations, and "litigation tourism" frames disability rights as frivolous lawsuits. People with disabilities face daily exclusions from employment, education, retail, and civic participation, while companies treat accessibility as optional compliance theater.

The tension emerges between accommodation costs and civil rights. Businesses claim accessibility requirements impose undue burdens, especially for small enterprises and legacy infrastructure. Disability advocates argue that "separate but equal" accommodations perpetuate discrimination and that universal design benefits everyone. Meanwhile, rapid technological change outpaces accessibility standards—AR interfaces lack screen reader support, AI-generated content fails alt-text requirements, and contactless systems exclude non-smartphone users. As remote work and digital services expand, digital inaccessibility becomes civil rights denial.

The stakes involve fundamental social participation. When transit systems remain inaccessible, employment opportunities vanish. When voting machines lack assistive features, democratic participation suffers. When educational platforms ignore accessibility, learning gaps widen. The crisis compounds existing inequalities: disabled people already face higher poverty rates, and accessibility failures trap them in dependency. As aging populations increase disability prevalence, inadequate accessibility becomes a mass societal barrier, affecting 25% of adults rather than a small minority.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Social Cohesion**: -10 to -20 when accessibility violations exclude disabled citizens
- **Employment Rate**: -5 to -15 as workplace inaccessibility limits job access
- **Education Quality**: -10 to -20 when schools and platforms fail accessibility standards
- **Infrastructure Quality**: -15 to -25 reflecting systematic accessibility gaps
- **Public Trust in Institutions**: -5 to -15 when enforcement fails to ensure compliance

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Disability Benefits Cliff** when inaccessibility forces reliance on benefits rather than employment
- Amplifies **Healthcare Access Deserts** when medical facilities lack accessible features
- Triggers **Digital Divide Deepening** as web/app inaccessibility creates information exclusion
- Amplifies **Employment Discrimination** when workplace inaccessibility justifies hiring barriers
- Triggers **Aging Infrastructure Crisis** when legacy buildings/systems lack accessibility retrofits

## Warning Signs

- High violation rates + Low enforcement budgets = Systematic non-compliance
- Digital transformation + Ignored WCAG standards = Mass digital exclusion
- Aging population + Inaccessible infrastructure = Growing affected population
- Lawsuit backlash framing + Rights rollback = Accessibility regression
- Emergency systems + No assistive features = Disaster vulnerability
- Remote work expansion + Platform inaccessibility = Employment exclusion
