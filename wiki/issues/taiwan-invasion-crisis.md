# Taiwan Invasion Crisis

## Overview

The risk of a Chinese military invasion or blockade of Taiwan represents one of the most acute existential threats to global stability in the 21st century. Taiwan's status as both a geopolitical flashpoint between the US and China and the world's critical supplier of advanced semiconductors (producing 92% of the world's most advanced chips) creates a scenario where local conflict could trigger cascading failures across global economies, military systems, and technological infrastructure. As of 2025-12-19, Xi Jinping is president of China. [^britannica-xi] Xi's consolidation of power and increasingly assertive rhetoric about "unification" have coincided with unprecedented military modernization and amphibious capability expansion, suggesting a shortened timeline to potential conflict compared to decades past.

A Taiwan invasion would not be a contained regional conflict. The People's Liberation Army's military buildup—including aircraft carriers, hypersonic missiles, and cyber warfare capabilities—combined with China's economic leverage over semiconductor supply chains, creates a scenario where even a successful defense would leave the global economy in crisis. Taiwan's semiconductor fabrication plants would become destruction targets, production zones, or fall under Chinese control, immediately causing shortages of microprocessors essential to everything from military systems to civilian infrastructure. This would cascade into automobile manufacturing collapse, artificial intelligence system failures, telecommunications breakdowns, and military hardware paralysis across allied nations.

The US strategic ambiguity regarding Taiwan defense has eroded in recent years, with explicit congressional commitments and military presence intensifications suggesting a likelihood of American intervention. This transforms a Taiwan conflict into a potential direct US-China military confrontation—a Great Power War scenario with nuclear capabilities on both sides. Historical precedent and game theory suggest that none of the primary actors (US, China, Taiwan) may have clean off-ramps once military action begins, creating a path to escalation that could exceed the scale of World War II in economic disruption and potentially approach nuclear exchange thresholds.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

**Military Capability Imbalance** (affects by ±15% yearly): As Chinese military asymmetrically advantages grow relative to Taiwan and US Pacific forces, invasion probability increases non-linearly. Once PLAN amphibious capability reaches 70%+ of required capacity for contested landing operations, baseline invasion probability jumps from 3-4% annually to 8-12%.

**US Commitment Clarity** (affects by ±20% per policy shift): Explicit US defense guarantees reduce invasion probability by 35-45%, but domestic political shifts or perceived American decline can rapidly reverse this. Taiwan's hedging between independence and unification rhetoric moves 5-8% annually based on this signal.

**Semiconductor Dependency Concentration** (affects economic impact by 150-280%): Taiwan's dominance in advanced chip production means invasion or blockade multiplies global economic damage. Each month of production disruption costs global GDP approximately $800B-$1.2T in downstream effects. This creates perverse incentive structures where economic actors might pressure political concessions to avoid conflict.

**Chinese Domestic Legitimacy Pressure** (affects by ±8% quarterly): Xi's political control depends on nationalist narratives and economic performance. Domestic recession or factional challenges increase pressure for "solving the Taiwan problem," raising invasion probability by 1-2% per quarter of significant economic contraction.

**Taiwan Public Sentiment** (affects by ±12% yearly): Growing Taiwanese identity and youth rejection of unification reduces surrender probability if invaded (increasing casualties) but may also trigger Chinese miscalculation about quick capitulation. High independence support paradoxically increases invasion risk even as it increases defense viability.

### Cascading Effects

**Semiconductor Supply Collapse** → **Military Hardware Paralysis**: Taiwan fab destruction or Chinese seizure immediately halts production of processors essential to missiles, fighter jets, radar systems, and communications. US and allied military readiness drops 40-60% within 6 months as stockpiles deplete and new platforms can't be manufactured. Defense contractors face multi-year recovery even post-conflict.

**Global Chip Shortage** → **Economic Depression**: Loss of Taiwan's advanced chip capacity triggers supply chain collapses in automotive (6-month production stoppage), servers/data centers (AI training frozen), telecommunications infrastructure (5G/6G deployment halted), and consumer electronics. Multiplier effects create global recession exceeding 2008 financial crisis in scope. Estimated global GDP loss: $8-15 trillion over 24 months.

**Trade Network Fragmentation** → **Regional Autarky**: Post-conflict, the US implements export controls on advanced technology to China, China retaliates with rare earth material restrictions, India hedges alignment, and ASEAN nations split between blocs. Global trade falls 25-35% below trend for 3-5 years. Recovery requires complete supply chain reconstruction away from China dependency.

**Financial System Instability** → **Credit Crises**: Currency volatility (yuan/dollar swings of 15-25%), equity market crashes (40-55% from peak), and defaults in supply chain financing trigger secondary financial crises. Central banks' policy responses become uncoordinated; some may face simultaneous currency and debt crises. Estimated banking sector losses: $2-4 trillion globally.

**Nuclear Escalation Pathway**: Direct US-China military engagement in Taiwan Strait creates risk of rapid escalation through conventional weapons thresholds to tactical nuclear use. Both nations possess nuclear arsenals; doctrinal statements from both sides suggest willingness to use nuclear weapons in "existential" conflicts. Even 1-2% probability of nuclear exchange represents unacceptable civilizational risk.

**Authoritarian Consolidation**: Successful Chinese takeover or negotiated unification of Taiwan enables Xi's model of AI-powered authoritarian governance (facial recognition, social credit, political control) to be applied to 23 million previously-democratic people. Demonstrates viability of undemocratic governance at scale, potentially emboldening similar moves in Hong Kong, South China Sea territories, and encouraging authoritarian momentum globally.

## Warning Signs

**Military Capability Milestones**: PLAN achieves 70%+ amphibious landing capacity (estimated 2026-2027 timeframe based on current buildup). Large-scale exercises near Taiwan increase from annual to quarterly frequency. Introduction of new-generation landing craft, air-cushion vehicles, or specialized amphibious aircraft signals preparation for contested operations.

**Political Signal Shifts**: Xi's rhetoric moves from "eventual reunification" to specific timelines or conditions. Domestic Chinese media shifts from "Taiwan is part of China" narrative to "Taiwan independence movement must be crushed militarily." Taiwan pro-independence party wins supermajority with mandate rejecting unification, creating Chinese narrative justification.

**Economic Pressure Intensification**: China implements selective semiconductor supply restrictions (rare earths, manufacturing equipment) on Taiwan. Financial restrictions target Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves. Tourism and trade restrictions create visible economic pain, testing public support for independence.

**US Commitment Ambiguity**: Congressional support for Taiwan defense weakens due to domestic political divisions or great power retreat sentiment. US military presence in Western Pacific is perceived as declining. A US administration signals neutrality or suggests Taiwan's fate is "internal Chinese matter." Taiwan perceives abandonment risk, potentially triggering capitulation or acceleration of military preparations.

**Alliance Fraying**: Japan signals reduced willingness to host US bases or participate in Taiwan defense. South Korea indicates potential neutrality in US-China conflict. Philippines or other ASEAN nations tilt toward China or declare neutrality. Australia backs away from explicit Taiwan defense statements. These signals suggest China's perception of allied support degradation and reduced cost of invasion.

**Domestic Crisis Triggering**: Significant Chinese economic contraction (GDP growth below 3%, unemployment spike, banking sector stress) combined with nationalist party factional conflict creates pressure for nationalist distraction. Taiwan's domestic political crisis (government paralysis, corruption scandals) suggests reduced capacity for defense. Either condition creates perceived "window of opportunity" for decisive action.

**Technological Parity Achievements**: Chinese AI, semiconductor, or hypersonic missile development reaches perceived parity with US. China claims "technological independence" from Taiwan fabs through new domestic capacity or import substitution. This narrative removes perceived costs of fab destruction and suggests post-invasion recovery possibility.
