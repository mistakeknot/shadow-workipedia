# Climate Insurance Collapse and Managed Retreat Wars

## Overview

Property insurance is breaking under the weight of climate risk. As extreme weather becomes predictable rather than exceptional, insurers withdraw from entire regions—first coasts, then wildfire zones, then anywhere with measurable climate exposure. This creates a vicious cascade: properties become uninsurable, mortgages become impossible to issue, property values collapse, homeowners lose their largest asset, municipal tax bases evaporate, and governments face a choice between managed retreat (buying out populations at pre-crisis prices they can no longer afford) or abandonment (leaving people stranded in uninsurable, un-mortgageable homes).

The result redistributes hundreds of trillions in wealth from ordinary homeowners to whoever controls the retreat timeline and buyout prices. Families who built generational wealth in now-vulnerable areas face financial ruin; municipalities go bankrupt managing climate-stranded populations; nations split into climate-safe and climate-sacrificed zones; and the insurance industry becomes a tool of economic triage, deciding who gets saved and who gets left behind.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**

- **Property Values**: Drop 40-80% in climate-identified zones within 3-8 years
- **Insurance Availability**: Falls from 100 to 20-40 index in affected regions; insurers withdraw in tiers (coastal, then flood zones, then heat/wildfire areas)
- **Insurance Costs**: Rise 200-500% where still available; becomes inaccessible to middle-income populations
- **Mortgage Lending**: Banks stop issuing mortgages in uninsurable zones; only cash purchases possible
- **Municipal Tax Revenue**: Collapses 30-60% as property values drop; funding for schools, roads, police shrinks catastrophically
- **Household Wealth**: Cumulative losses of $8-12 trillion in US alone by 2040; concentrated among homeowners in climate zones
- **Economic Inequality**: Widens dramatically as climate-safe zones (prices rise) diverge from climate-sacrificed zones (prices collapse)
- **Debt Defaults**: Rise 3-7x in climate zones as homeowners lose equity and mortgage payments become irrational

**Cascading Effects:**

- Triggers **Climate Refugee Floods** as insurance-driven property collapse forces mass relocation
- Amplifies **Wealth Inequality Spiral** by 50-80% as homeowner asset destruction concentrates among middle-income populations
- Creates **Infrastructure Stranding Cascades** when entire zones are abandoned but infrastructure remains economically unsustainable
- Accelerates **Coastal Property Abandonment** by 3-5x; compresses timeline from decades to 5-10 years
- Destabilizes **Financial System** when real estate-backed collateral evaporates; mortgage-backed securities become toxic
- Leads to **Political Fragmentation** as climate-safe and climate-sacrificed zones develop antagonistic interests

## Warning Signs

- **Insurers Begin Rate Hikes + Actuarial Model Updates** → Withdrawal begins within 18-24 months
- **Property Value Decline in Coastal/Wildfire Zones + Rising Premiums** → Market is pricing in uninsurability; collapse timeline accelerates
- **First FAIR Plan Creation + Government Signals Buyout Discussion** → Managed retreat officially on agenda; property values enter free-fall
- **Banks Adjust Mortgage Guidelines + Denials Spike** → Lending lockout underway; supply of buyers evaporates
- **Multiple Regions Announcing Buyout Programs Simultaneously** → System is in triage mode; widespread recognition that retreat is inevitable
- **Property Tax Revenue Decline + Municipal Budget Stress** → Tax base erosion underway; local services begin deteriorating
- **Speculative Real Estate Crash + REIT Margin Calls** → Financial system contagion has begun
- **Insurance Availability Index Below 30 + Retreat Population Over 5 Million** → System has reached critical point; nationwide cascade imminent

## Insurance Availability Cascade

The insurance system operates on an **Availability Index** (0-100):

- **90-100 (Normal)**: Full availability; standard premiums; all properties insurable
- **70-89 (Elevated)**: Rates rise 50-100%; some high-risk properties excluded
- **50-69 (High Risk)**: Rates rise 150-300%; FAIR plans become necessary for marginal properties
- **30-49 (Crisis)**: Private market largely exits; government programs overwhelmed; rates spike 300-500%
- **10-29 (Collapse)**: Private insurance almost nonexistent; only state pools/FAIR plans; premiums astronomical ($10,000-20,000+/year)
- **0-9 (Total Failure)**: De facto uninsurable; government programs bankrupt; residents self-insure or abandon

**Index Drivers:**
- Climate hazard exposure (40% weight): coastal flooding, wildfire risk, heat projections, hurricane frequency
- Historical loss frequency (25% weight): insurance claims over past 10 years
- Expected future losses (20% weight): actuarial projections for 5-20 year horizon
- Insurer market concentration (10% weight): when major insurers exit, remaining capacity shrinks
- Regulatory pressure (5% weight): government interventions to force coverage have minimal impact

## Property Value Collapse Stages

**Stage 1: Early Warning (Availability 80-70)**
- Values stable or declining 2-3% annually
- Informed investors start selling; first insurance rate hikes appear

**Stage 2: Recognition (Availability 70-50)**
- Values decline 8-15% annually
- Market liquidity drops; time-on-market increases 60-100%
- First mortgage denials on marginal properties

**Stage 3: Collapse (Availability 50-20)**
- Values decline 20-40% annually
- Market nearly seizes; forced sales (default, tax foreclosure) accelerate
- REITs and institutional investors absorb properties at steep discounts

**Stage 4: Stagnation (Availability Below 20)**
- Values stabilize at 30-50% of pre-crisis peak
- Market becomes illiquid; only cash buyers or speculators remain
- Managed retreat buyouts become primary market mechanism

## Managed Retreat Economics

Buyout programs relocate populations using government funds, but pricing creates severe conflicts:

**Pricing Model:**
- Government typically offers 70-80% of pre-crisis baseline (2015-2019 values)
- Homeowner loses 20-30% of property wealth instantly
- Owners who sell early (values at 80-90% of peak) do better than late sellers (values at 40% of peak)

**Example - California Coastal Property:**
- 2018 Market Value: $2.5M
- Government Offer (75% of 2015 baseline): $1.65M (33% loss)
- Current Market Value (2030): $0.9M (64% loss)
- Either way: massive wealth destruction

**Program Mechanics:**
1. Announcement triggers immediate waves of selling
2. Valuation process causes 6-12 month delays; values decline 5-10% during wait
3. Property owners decide: accept offer or hold out for potentially higher price
4. Accepted properties transferred to government; demolished or held for ecological restoration
5. Entire process typically 18-36 months per property; stretched across decades for large programs

**Incentive Problems:**
- Holdouts face isolation as surrounding properties evacuate; utilities/services fail; effectively uninhabitable
- Program funding limitations mean not all properties can be bought; rationing occurs
- Geographic clustering creates "retreat zones" and "holdout zones"—ghettos of abandoned/defiant properties

## Financial System Contagion

Real estate-backed instruments create systemic risk when property values collapse:

**Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) Chain:**
1. Property value decline → collateral worth less
2. Default rate increase → more underwater mortgages
3. MBS valuation crisis → rating downgrades; losses accelerate
4. Portfolio impact → banks, pension funds, insurance companies face mark-to-market losses
5. Capital calls → institutions forced to raise capital; credit markets seize

**REIT Failure Chain:**
1. Portfolio devaluation → REITs holding climate-exposed properties see 30-50% asset decline
2. Leverage amplification → REITs use 2-3x leverage; 40% asset decline = 80-120% equity decline
3. Margin calls → lenders demand collateral; REITs forced to sell at steep discounts
4. Asset firesale → liquidation floods market; prices collapse further
5. Pension fund exposure → public pension funds holding REIT shares suffer losses

## Historical Timeline

- **2017-2020**: First major insurers announce coastal/wildfire withdrawals (State Farm, Allstate in California and Florida)
- **2021-2023**: FAIR plans expand; premiums spike 100-200% in high-risk zones
- **2024-2026**: Multiple states create insurer-of-last-resort programs; all prove structurally underfunded
- **2027-2030**: Mortgage market lockouts begin; Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac revise underwriting to exclude uninsurable properties
- **2028-2032**: First wave of managed retreat buyout programs; widespread property owner resistance
- **2030-2034**: Financial system contagion as multiple state insurance markets collapse simultaneously; 2008-scale crisis triggered by climate real estate collapse

## Impact on Shadow Work Systems

**Economy:** Real estate sector collapses; construction unemployment spikes 3-5x; insurance industry consolidates; smaller carriers fail; broader recession triggered; wealth concentration increases as property transfers to speculators at distressed prices

**Real Estate:** Bifurcation into climate-safe (expensive, high demand) and climate-vulnerable (cheap, declining) zones; managed retreat creates ghost towns; infrastructure in abandoned zones becomes economically unsustainable

**Politics:** Regional political fragmentation as climate-safe vs. climate-sacrifice zones develop antagonistic interests; political movements demand federal compensation; property rights vs. climate adaptation becomes major fault line

**Inequality:** Dramatic wealth loss among middle-income homeowners in climate zones; racial dimensions as sacrifice zones overlap with communities of color; buyout programs perceived as racialized wealth extraction; intergenerational wealth destruction

**Infrastructure:** Stranded infrastructure (power grids, water systems, roads) serving depopulating zones becomes economically irrational to maintain; selective abandonment creates new geographic inequalities
