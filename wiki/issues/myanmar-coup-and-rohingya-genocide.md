# Myanmar Coup and Rohingya Genocide

## Overview

Myanmar faces a catastrophic convergence of military authoritarianism and ethnic cleansing that represents one of the world's most acute humanitarian emergencies. In February 2021, the Myanmar military (Tatmadaw) overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, citing electoral fraud in the November 2020 elections that were widely considered legitimate by international observers. This coup reversed a decade of tentative democratic progress and plunged the country into violent instability, with widespread armed resistance and civil disobedience across major cities and rural areas.

Simultaneously, the crisis has intensified the ongoing persecution of the Rohingya, a stateless Muslim ethnic minority. Beginning with large-scale violence in 2017 that killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly 750,000 to neighboring Bangladesh, the Rohingya face systematic genocide—deliberate attempts to eliminate them as a people through killing, sexual violence, displacement, and forced assimilation. The military junta maintains complete impunity despite mounting evidence of crimes against humanity and genocide, while the international community lacks enforcement mechanisms to intervene. Bangladesh now hosts nearly 1 million Rohingya in sprawling refugee camps facing disease, malnutrition, human trafficking, and radical recruitment.

The combination of military dictatorship, ethnic warfare, and refugee displacement creates cascading humanitarian, economic, and geopolitical consequences across Southeast Asia. Regional stability deteriorates as neighboring states struggle to contain spillover effects, Thailand and Malaysia face increased refugee arrivals, and China's strategic interests in Myanmar complicate international responses. Economic collapse, brain drain of educated professionals, and the militarization of governance threaten Myanmar's long-term development and regional prosperity.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

- **Authoritarianism** (+45 points per turn): Military consolidation of power increases state repression, decreases civil liberties, and strengthens institutional opposition to democracy. Creates conditions for ethnic scapegoating and violence.

- **Ethnic Tension** (+38 points per turn): Persecution of Rohingya and marginalization of other minorities (Shan, Karen, Kachin) drives communal violence, triggers armed insurgencies, and destabilizes entire regions. Each atrocity increases radicalization.

- **Refugee Pressure** (+52 points per turn): Nearly 1 million Rohingya in Bangladesh camps strain host nation capacity, trigger disease outbreaks (cholera, dengue), increase human trafficking networks, and destabilize border regions across Myanmar-Bangladesh-Thailand-Malaysia transit routes.

- **Economic Collapse** (+35 points per turn): Military coup triggers capital flight, foreign investment exodus, currency devaluation, and sanctions. GDP contraction accelerates poverty, unemployment, and social breakdown especially in urban areas.

- **International Isolation** (+28 points per turn): Coup and genocide documentation isolates Myanmar diplomatically, reduces aid flows, complicates regional partnerships, and pushes the country toward dependency on China for economic and military support.

### Cascading Effects

- **Genocide → Refugee Camps → Disease Outbreaks → Regional Instability**: Mass displacement from Myanmar creates overcrowded camps in Bangladesh with inadequate sanitation. Poor conditions enable rapid disease transmission (cholera R₀~1.5-2.0, dengue vector breeding in stagnant water). Health crises trigger Bangladesh border closures, Thailand/Malaysia pushback operations, and regional diplomatic tensions.

- **Military Coup → Civil Disobedience → Armed Insurgency → Humanitarian Crisis**: Opposition to coup triggers non-violent resistance (strikes, boycotts). Military response radicalizes dissidents into armed groups. Intensified conflict destroys infrastructure, displaces populations, and creates secondary refugee waves beyond Rohingya communities. Shan, Karen, Kachin minorities weaponize in response.

- **Economic Collapse → Brain Drain → State Capacity Loss → Service Breakdown**: Currency collapse and hyperinflation force doctors, engineers, and educated professionals to emigrate. Hospital closures, power grid failures, water system breakdowns. Creates positive feedback: state capacity loss → more emigration → faster collapse.

- **International Isolation → China Dependency → Geopolitical Realignment → Regional Destabilization**: Western sanctions push Myanmar toward exclusive dependence on Chinese investment and military support. China's Belt and Road loans become debt trap (infrastructure collateral). Myanmar becomes de facto Chinese client state, destabilizing US-China competition in Southeast Asia. Japan, India, ASEAN weaken as regional players.

- **Rohingya Genocide → Islamic Radicalization → Transnational Extremism → Security Threats**: Stateless Rohingya in camps become recruitment pools for ISIS, Al-Qaeda regional affiliates, and transnational jihadist networks. Grievances over genocide drive terrorist attacks in Southeast Asia, India, Middle East. Creates security justification for increased militarization and Islamophobia.

## Warning Signs

- **Military Mobilization and Cabinet Control**: Arrest of civilian government officials, purges of military officers loyal to democracy, appointment of military generals to civilian cabinet positions (finance, commerce, health). Indicates coup preparation.

- **Escalating Ethnic Violence Against Rohingya**: Sudden spike in military operations in Rohingya zones, credible reports of mass killings, sexual violence used systematically as weapon, forced relocations to isolated areas. Suggests genocide intensification rather than containment.

- **Camp Condition Deterioration in Bangladesh**: Declining nutrition metrics, rising disease incidence (especially cholera/dengue), suicide rates increasing among refugees, gang violence and trafficking expanding, deteriorating WASH (water, sanitation, hygiene) infrastructure. Indicates humanitarian crisis at critical threshold.

- **Cross-Border Refugee Movements and Pushbacks**: Sudden increases in Rohingya boat arrivals to Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia. Corresponding maritime pushback operations and capsizing incidents. Indicates pressure buildup in Bangladesh camps approaching collapse.

- **Armed Resistance Coordination**: Proven coordination between Tatmadaw defectors and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), supply line penetration to opposition groups, defection rates of soldiers and officers accelerating. Indicates civil war moving from asymmetric to conventional warfare.

- **Currency and Banking System Stress**: Rapid currency devaluation (Kyat losing >10% of value), bank runs, currency speculation, inflation of essential goods (food, fuel, medicine) exceeding 30% annually, capital flight visible in financial flows. Indicates economic system approaching breakdown.
