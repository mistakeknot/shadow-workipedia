# Turkey Erdogan Authoritarianism

## Overview

As of 2025-12-19, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is president of Turkey. [^britannica-erdogan]

Turkey's descent into authoritarianism under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan represents one of the most significant democratic collapses in a NATO-member state since the Cold War. What began in 2002 as a reform-oriented Justice and Development Party (AKP) government has progressively consolidated power through constitutional amendments, institutional capture, and systematic suppression of opposition. The 2016 coup attempt provided the pretext for an unprecedented purge—over 130,000 public officials, military personnel, judges, teachers, and journalists were arrested or dismissed, often with minimal due process. This transformation fundamentally altered Turkey's domestic governance structure while simultaneously creating tensions with Western allies over human rights, the rule of law, and NATO operational cohesion.

The mechanisms driving Turkey's authoritarianism extend beyond Erdogan's personal ambitions to encompass broader structural factors: religious-secular polarization inherited from Atatürk's founding vision, a tradition of military interventionism, ethnic tensions with the Kurdish minority, and economic pressures from geographic positioning between Europe, Russia, and the Middle East. Erdogan's government has methodically dismantled institutional checks on executive power, subordinating the judiciary through loyalist appointments, controlling media through ownership stakes and licensing threats, and criminalizing dissent under vague terrorism and insulting-the-president statutes. This concentration of power has created both domestic instability—manifested in economic volatility, investor uncertainty, and generational cultural conflict—and international complications for NATO, which finds itself dependent on Turkey's strategic Bosphorus position while unable to compel democratic reforms without risking abandonment by a critical ally.

The international ramifications extend far beyond Turkish borders. Turkey's pivot toward Russia in energy markets, its role as a swing-vote in NATO decisions (particularly regarding Ukraine and Nordic expansion), and its military operations in Syria and Iraq create leverage that Erdogan exploits to resist Western pressure on democratic governance. Conversely, the West's strategic dependence on Turkey paradoxically empowers authoritarian consolidation by weakening incentives for course correction. This creates a structural trap: Turkey's democratic collapse proceeds without effective countermeasure because the costs of confrontation exceed the costs of tolerance, while within Turkey, citizens face the grim calculation that international isolation has already occurred without producing systemic change.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

- **Institutional Capture** (+15-25 points): Each appointment of loyalist judges, prosecutors, and bureaucrats increases Institutional Capture, reducing the independence of checks on executive power. At high levels (>70), constitutional amendments pass with minimal opposition, enabling the shift to a presidential system (enacted 2018).

- **Press Freedom Degradation** (+8-12 points): Attacks on critical journalists, licensing revocation for media outlets, and defamation lawsuits reduce press freedom. Above 60 points, independent reporting becomes financially unviable, leaving state-aligned media as dominant information source.

- **Polarization Index** (+10-18 points): Religious-secular, ethnic, and political divides widen as civic space shrinks. Polarization >75 makes national consensus on any major policy nearly impossible, fragmenting electoral coalitions and enabling continued AKP dominance through plurality rule.

- **Kurdish Tension** (+12-20 points): Military operations against PKK/YPG, restrictions on HDP opposition party, and arrested Kurdish politicians increase this parameter. Spikes trigger refugee flows and regional destabilization, affecting NATO cohesion on Middle East policy.

- **Economic Volatility** (+6-10 points): Unorthodox monetary policy, currency interventions, and investor flight from political uncertainty cause lira depreciation and inflation cycles. Above 65 points, unemployment spikes to 10-12%, destabilizing middle-class support for AKP.

### Cascading Effects

- **Judicial Capture → Economic Instability**: As courts become subordinate to executive control, investor confidence erodes. Foreign direct investment declines 15-25% per year of accelerating judicial capture, triggering currency pressure and inflation.

- **Press Freedom Loss → Polarization Amplification**: State-dominated media amplifies divisive narratives while suppressing counterarguments. For every 10-point increase in press freedom degradation above 50, polarization increases by 3-5 points as information ecosystem fragments.

- **Institutional Capture → NATO Vulnerability**: With no independent judiciary to enforce rule of law, NATO operational procedures and intelligence-sharing protocols face compromise risks. NATO members increasingly restrict sensitive operations through Turkish airspace, reducing alliance military effectiveness by 8-12%.

- **Economic Crisis + Polarization → Protest Escalation**: When unemployment exceeds 11% AND polarization exceeds 70 simultaneously, mass street protests become likely (probability increases 0.15 per quarter), with 30-40% risk of violent clashes and state overreaction.

- **Kurdish Tension + Regional Instability → Refugee Flows**: Escalation of PKK operations or Turkish military campaigns against YPG trigger 50,000-200,000 refugee flows to Europe and neighboring states, straining EU-Turkey relations and NATO-EU coordination.

## Warning Signs

- **Rapid turnover of institutional leadership**: When >60% of judges, prosecutors, or military command change within 12 months, expect accelerated institutional capture and rule-of-law decline.

- **Frequency of terror/insulting-the-president charges against opposition figures**: Statistically above 100 charges annually against political opponents indicates criminalization of dissent; correlates with 0.25 probability of major opposition crackdown within 6 months.

- **Lira depreciation rate >15% annually**: Signals investor loss of confidence; when combined with official interest rate suppression, indicates economic policy crisis with 0.18 probability of major correction event.

- **Press freedom index drops >8 points in single year**: Indicates coordinated media suppression campaign; typically precedes major opposition crackdown or constitutional change by 2-4 months.

- **NATO disagreement frequency on key votes**: When Turkey blocks or abstains on >2 major NATO decisions annually (Ukraine, Nordic expansion, etc.), signals leveraging of strategic position for domestic political benefit, increasing risk of NATO operational friction and intelligence-sharing restrictions.

- **University rector dismissals and academic purges**: Purges of 50+ academic leaders from universities typically precede broader institutional capture and intelligence service expansion; correlates with 0.22 probability of major press or opposition crackdowns within 3 months.
