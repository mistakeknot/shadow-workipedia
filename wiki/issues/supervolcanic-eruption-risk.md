# Supervolcanic Eruption Risk

## Overview

Supervolcanic eruption risk describes the low-probability but civilization- threatening possibility of a VEI-8 volcanic eruption. Several active caldera systems—Yellowstone (USA), Campi Flegrei (Italy), Taupo (New Zealand), and the Toba caldera (Indonesia)—have produced such eruptions in geological history.
A supervolcanic eruption would inject enough sulfur aerosols to cause a volcanic winter lasting years, with global temperature drops sufficient to cause simultaneous crop failures worldwide. Unlike other existential risks, supervolcanic eruptions cannot be prevented—only prepared for. The Toba eruption is often cited as an example of how a single event can reshape global climate and stress food systems for years. While annual probability is very low, the consequences are so severe that this represents a genuine existential risk category.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Caldera Unrest Escalation**: A major caldera system (Yellowstone, Campi Flegrei, Taupo, Toba) shows escalating seismic activity, ground deformation, and gas emissions beyond historical baselines.
- **VEI-7 Eruption**: A large volcanic eruption (VEI 7) causes regional devastation and measurable global climate effects, serving as warning of supervolcanic potential.
- **Volcanic Winter Onset**: Massive sulfur aerosol injection causes global temperature drops of several degrees, triggering crop failures across multiple continents simultaneously.
- **Evacuation Zone Expansion**: Authorities expand evacuation zones around high-risk calderas, displacing millions and triggering real estate collapse in affected regions.
- **Global Food System Collapse**: Multiple consecutive failed harvests from volcanic cooling exhaust food reserves, triggering famine and mass migration on unprecedented scale.
- **Ash Infrastructure Failure**: Volcanic ash grounds aviation, collapses structures, contaminates water supplies, and destroys agriculture across continental-scale areas.
- **Supervolcanic Early Warning Debate**: Scientific community debates predictability and warning timelines, with policy implications for preparation investment.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Eruption** -> **Aerosol Injection**: Supervolcanic eruptions inject massive sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, reflecting sunlight and causing rapid global cooling lasting years to decades.
- **Volcanic Winter** -> **Agricultural Collapse**: Several degrees of cooling can cause simultaneous crop failures across hemispheres. Unlike localized disasters, no region can compensate for others.
- **Food Crisis** -> **Civilizational Stress**: Global food reserves last months, not years. Extended volcanic winter would exhaust reserves, collapse trade systems, and trigger mass migration and conflict.
- **Ash Fall** -> **Infrastructure Paralysis**: Continental ash deposits collapse buildings, ground all aviation, contaminate water, and destroy agriculture for years in affected zones.

## Warning Signs

- Elevated seismic activity at major caldera systems
- Ground deformation measurements showing magma chamber inflation
- Increased volcanic gas emissions (SO2, CO2) at calderas
- Hydrothermal activity changes at Yellowstone or Campi Flegrei
- Scientific papers revising eruption probability estimates upward
- Insurance industry modeling volcanic catastrophe scenarios
- Government contingency planning for caldera evacuations
- Historical analysis revealing more frequent past supervolcanic events
- VEI-6 or VEI-7 eruptions elsewhere demonstrating global climate impacts
- International coordination efforts for volcanic monitoring increasing
