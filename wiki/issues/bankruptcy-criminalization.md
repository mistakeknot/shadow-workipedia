# Bankruptcy Criminalization

## Overview

Despite constitutional prohibitions on debtors' prisons, the American legal system increasingly criminalizes poverty and debt through mechanisms that incarcerate people for unpaid fines, fees, and civil judgments. Court fees, probation charges, child support arrears, and municipal fines accumulate into unpayable debts, leading to arrest warrants, license suspensions, and jail time. Private debt collectors use court systems to secure judgments, then leverage contempt proceedings to imprison debtors. The cycle becomes inescapable: incarceration costs jobs, increasing inability to pay, triggering further warrants. While bankruptcy theoretically offers discharge, filing fees themselves are unaffordable, and means-testing excludes the poorest debtors.

The tension emerges between debt collection and civil liberties. Municipalities dependent on fines and fees criminalize poverty to fund services, creating modern debtor's prisons in Ferguson-style revenue policing. Courts issue pay-or-stay warrants without ability-to-pay hearings, violating constitutional protections. Private probation companies profit from supervision fees, extending sentences for those who cannot pay. Credit card companies and medical debt buyers weaponize court systems, securing judgments against people who cannot afford lawyers, then using contempt powers to extract payment. As income inequality rises and social safety nets shrink, more families face debts they cannot discharge.

The stakes involve fundamental rights and economic mobility. When driver's licenses suspend for unpaid court debt, people cannot reach employment. When warrants issue for missed payment plans, stable housing becomes impossible. When probation extends indefinitely due to unpaid fees, criminal records compound. The criminalization disproportionately affects Black and low-income communities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and incarceration. As bankruptcy becomes inaccessible and debt collection tactics intensify, the working poor face Victorian-era debtors' prisons rebranded as "civil contempt" and "failure to appear."

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Social Cohesion**: -15 to -25 as debt criminalization fractures communities
- **Inequality**: +15 to +30 with wealth-based incarceration systems
- **Economic Mobility**: -20 to -35 as debt traps prevent advancement
- **Public Trust in Justice System**: -15 to -30 when courts become debt collection agencies
- **Incarceration Rate**: +10 to +20 from contempt/warrant arrests
- **Employment Rate**: -5 to -15 as license suspensions and jail time cost jobs

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Cash Bail as Debtors' Prison** when fee debt leads to inability to post bail
- Amplifies **Medical Debt Crisis** as hospital judgments lead to wage garnishment and contempt
- Triggers **Student Loan Debt Crisis** intersection when educational debt compounds with court fees
- Amplifies **Homelessness** when warrants and license suspensions prevent stable housing/employment
- Triggers **Mass Incarceration** expansion through civil contempt mechanisms
- Amplifies **Racial Inequality** as enforcement disproportionately targets Black communities

## Warning Signs

- Municipal budget gaps + Fine/fee dependency = Revenue policing escalation
- High debt levels + Aggressive collection tactics = Mass contempt proceedings
- Unaffordable bankruptcy + Mounting debts = Permanent debt trap
- License suspensions + Employment requirements = Impossible compliance
- Private probation expansion + Fee-based extensions = Indefinite supervision
- Warrant backlogs + Minor debts = Mass incarceration risk
- Ability-to-pay hearing absence + Automatic warrants = Constitutional violations
