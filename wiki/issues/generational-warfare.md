# Generational Warfare

## Overview

Generational warfare describes the political and social conflict emerging between age cohorts as their material interests diverge. Baby Boomers accumulated wealth in housing and pensions during favorable economic conditions. Subsequent generations face unaffordable housing, precarious employment, climate consequences, and the bill for elder entitlements.
Democratic systems skew toward older voters who participate more consistently. The result is systematic policy bias toward retirees already receiving benefits at the expense of future generations. As these dynamics become explicit, age-based political conflict increasingly dominates traditional ideological divisions.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Wealth Transfer Failure**: Promised intergenerational wealth transfers fail to materialize. Older generations spend down assets on healthcare and longevity, leaving younger generations without expected inheritance.
- **Pension Reform Riots**: Attempts to reform unsustainable pension systems trigger massive elderly protests. Politicians choose protecting existing retirees over future generations.
- **Housing Ladder Collapse**: Young adults permanently locked out of homeownership as property becomes investment vehicle for older generations. Rental serfdom becomes generational destiny.
- **Climate Blame Politics**: Young generations explicitly blame elders for climate inaction. Climate policy becomes generational wedge issue, with youth demanding radical action over elder objections.
- **Age-Based Political Realignment**: Traditional left-right political alignment gives way to young-old axis. Parties form around generational interests rather than ideology.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Housing Lock-Out** → **Family Formation Collapse**: Young adults who cannot afford homes delay or forgo family formation, accelerating fertility decline and demographic collapse.
- **Pension Politics** → **Fiscal Crisis**: Protecting elderly entitlements requires either crushing taxation of workers or unsustainable debt. Both options fuel generational resentment.
- **Political Capture** → **Reform Paralysis**: Elderly voters outnumber and outvote young people. Democratic systems produce policies that transfer from future to present.
- **Climate Conflict** → **Social Fracture**: Generational blame for climate inaction undermines social solidarity and intergenerational trust necessary for collective action.

## Warning Signs

- Age becoming strongest predictor of political alignment
- Homeownership rates for young adults falling sharply
- Youth life satisfaction and optimism declining across surveys
- Retirement age debates becoming increasingly contentious
- Climate protest movements explicitly generational in framing
- Social media discourse framing generations as adversaries
- Policy debates explicitly trading off young vs old interests
