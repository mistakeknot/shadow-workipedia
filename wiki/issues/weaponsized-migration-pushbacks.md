## Overview

States increasingly weaponize migration flows as a deliberate geopolitical tool, transforming asylum seekers and migrants into instruments of statecraft. Rather than treating migration as a humanitarian or regulatory challenge, certain regimes deliberately facilitate or manipulate migrant movements toward rival nations to destabilize their borders, overwhelm social services, and inflame domestic political tensions. This represents a fundamental degradation of international refugee protection frameworks and the 1951 Refugee Convention, as vulnerable populations become expendable in zero-sum games between states.

The most prominent example is Belarus's systematic orchestration of migrant flows toward Poland (2021-2022), where the Lukashenko regime directly facilitated transit for thousands of Iraqi, Syrian, and Afghan migrants, chartered flights from the Middle East to Minsk, and then coordinated their movement to the Polish border. Polish security forces responded with illegal pushbacks—forcibly returning migrants across borders without processing asylum claims—resulting in deaths in forests and documented cases of hypothermia, dehydration, and exposure. Meanwhile, the EU faced a deliberate crisis designed to embarrass Warsaw and pressure EU cohesion, weaponizing human desperation as a political leverage point.

Mediterranean pushbacks represent another dimension of this weaponization. European states and coast guards have systematically prevented rescue operations, refused to accept migrants pulled from drowning boats, and used increasingly violent methods to turn away vessels—including ramming tactics. Libya's coast guard, trained and funded by European nations specifically to intercept migrants, forces boat captains back toward one of the world's most dangerous failed states, where migrants face slavery, organ trafficking, and torture camps operated with state knowledge. This creates a perverse incentive structure: by making the journey maximally lethal, states hope to deter migration itself. Instead, the strategy outsources state-sponsored violence onto private networks and criminal smugglers while maintaining plausible deniability. The weaponization extends to treating NGO rescue operations—organizations saving drowning people—as security threats subject to criminal prosecution.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects
- **Border Tensions**: +45 (physical confrontations, diplomatic incidents)
- **Human Rights Standing**: -40 (international criticism and isolation)
- **Refugee Processing**: -35 (system overwhelm and collapse)
- **Regional Stability**: -30 (deteriorating neighbor state relations)
- **Migration Routes**: +25 (stimulates more dangerous unofficial routes)
- **Domestic Polarization**: +35 (exploited by nationalist movements)

### Event Types
- Mass coordinated pushback incidents at borders (hundreds in single operations)
- Diplomatic crises and retaliatory sanctions over migrant treatment
- Humanitarian disasters: deaths in forests, seas, deserts
- International court cases and human rights tribunal proceedings
- NGO and rescue worker prosecutions
- State-coordinated migrant facilitation programs
- Breakdown of bilateral border agreements

## Cascading Effects

Weaponized migration connects to and amplifies:

- **European Migration Crisis**: Deliberate pushback policies drive migrants toward more dangerous alternative routes through deserts and seas, increasing casualties while not reducing overall migration
- **Climate Refugee Floods**: Climate-displaced populations have fewer international protections and become easier targets for weaponization as "economic migrants" rather than refugees
- **Comprehensive Refugee System Collapse**: When major UN signatories systematically violate asylum norms, the entire international protection framework loses legitimacy and enforcement capacity

Each state's policy of pushbacks and obstruction incentivizes other states to adopt identical tactics, creating a race to the bottom where refugee protection disappears entirely.

## Warning Signs

- Rising documented border deaths and disappearances with state actor involvement
- State officials explicitly threatening to facilitate migrant flows toward rival nations
- Suspension of asylum processing or deliberately impossible application procedures
- Coast guard and border force tactics escalating from interception to violence
- NGO rescue operations criminalized under immigration or security laws
- Migrants systematically denied food, water, or medical care at borders
- Coordinated facilitation of transit from third countries toward specific targets
- Diplomatic threats tied to migration flows ("If you don't comply, we'll send more migrants")
