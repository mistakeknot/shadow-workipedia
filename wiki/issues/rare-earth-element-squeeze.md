# Rare Earth Element Squeeze

## Overview

Rare earth elements (REEs) are critical inputs for modern technology, from smartphones and defense systems to renewable energy infrastructure. China controls over 80% of global processing capacity despite holding only ~37% of proven reserves, creating a strategic vulnerability that threatens the global green transition and technology supply chains. Supply restrictions, mining accidents, or trade weaponization could cripple EV production, wind turbine manufacturing, and advanced electronics at precisely the moment when accelerating decarbonization depends on rapid scaling.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Technology Production Capacity**: Constrained supply reduces manufacturing rates for EVs, renewable energy infrastructure, and semiconductors. Shortage events can trigger 15-25% production penalties across tech-dependent sectors
- **Green Transition Speed**: Limited REE availability slows the rollout of wind turbines, battery production, and electric vehicle manufacturing. Can introduce 1-3 year delays in decarbonization timelines
- **Strategic Vulnerability**: Nations dependent on REE imports face geopolitical pressure. Trade restrictions increase vulnerability index and trigger cascading supply chain disruptions
- **Mining Environmental Impact**: Increased demand for REE extraction accelerates habitat destruction, water pollution, and radioactive waste accumulation in mining regions
- **Trade Dependency**: Concentration of processing in single regions creates leverage points for trade weaponization and bilateral tensions with major importing nations

**Event Types:**
1. **Export Restriction**: China (or other dominant processor) restricts REE exports in response to sanctions, trade disputes, or internal demand. Effect: 30-50% supply reduction, 2-4 quarter duration
2. **New Deposit Discovery**: Large, economically viable REE deposits found outside China. Effect: Reduces trade dependency by 10-15%, diversifies supply chains, increases competition
3. **Processing Plant Accident**: Industrial accident (fire, explosion, chemical release) disrupts processing capacity at major facility. Effect: 20-35% temporary supply reduction, 1-2 quarter recovery period
4. **Recycling Breakthrough**: New recycling technologies make it economically viable to recover REEs from electronic waste. Effect: Reduces demand pressure, improves circularity, decreases mining pressure by 15-20%
5. **Strategic Stockpile Release**: Government releases strategic reserves to stabilize markets. Effect: Short-term supply relief (2-3 quarters), improves stability index but depletes reserves

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Supply Chain Fragility** when export restrictions persist for 2+ quarters
- Amplifies **Green Transition Gridlock** when mining environmental costs exceed acceptable thresholds
- Intensifies **Great Power Rivalry Redux** when trade weaponization occurs
- Fuels demand for **Electric Vehicle Revolution** as manufacturers compete for limited REE supplies

## Warning Signs

- China's processing capacity exceeds 70% AND global REE demand increases 10%+ annually = Acute shortage risk
- Multiple nations pursuing simultaneous domestic REE development projects = Price volatility incoming
- Major REE processing facility accident + trade tensions = Supply chain cascade risk
- Recycling recovery rates below 5% AND mining environmental damage accelerating = Long-term sustainability crisis
