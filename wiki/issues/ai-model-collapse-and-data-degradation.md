# AI Model Collapse and Data Degradation

## Overview

AI model collapse and data degradation describes the risk that artificial intelligence systems degrade as they increasingly train on AI-generated content rather than human-created data. As AI produces more of the internet's text, images, and code, future AI training datasets become contaminated with synthetic content that compounds errors and loses information.
Research demonstrates that models trained recursively on their own outputs experience "model collapse"—progressive quality degradation across generations. Combined with adversarial data poisoning attacks, this creates fundamental constraints on AI improvement that may not be solvable through additional compute or scale, potentially triggering an AI capability plateau or reversal.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Training Data Contamination Discovery**: Major AI labs discover their training datasets are substantially contaminated with AI-generated content, forcing expensive data curation efforts.
- **Model Performance Plateau**: New model generations show diminishing improvements as high-quality human-generated training data becomes scarce relative to synthetic content.
- **Recursive Degradation Incident**: An AI system trained on AI-generated content produces noticeably degraded outputs, demonstrating model collapse in production systems.
- **Data Provenance Standard Adoption**: Industry adopts cryptographic provenance standards to verify human- generated content, creating two-tier data markets.
- **Adversarial Data Poisoning Attack**: State or criminal actors deliberately inject poisoned data into public datasets, compromising models trained on web-scraped content.
- **Human Data Premium Market**: Verified human-generated content commands significant premiums, creating new economics around data creation and curation.
- **AI Winter Concerns**: Investment community begins questioning AI scaling laws as data quality constraints become apparent, affecting valuations and funding.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **AI Content Flood** -> **Training Pollution**: As AI generates more internet content, future AI training increasingly learns from AI outputs. Each generation compounds errors and loses information present in original human data.
- **Model Collapse** -> **Capability Ceiling**: Without access to fresh human- generated data, AI improvement rates slow or reverse. The scaling laws that drove recent progress may reach fundamental limits.
- **Data Poisoning** -> **Trust Collapse**: Adversarial contamination of training data creates unpredictable model failures. Organizations cannot trust AI systems trained on potentially compromised datasets.
- **Quality Degradation** -> **AI Winter**: If model collapse becomes visible in commercial products, the AI investment boom may reverse. Companies that bet on continued scaling face stranded assets.

## Warning Signs

- Studies showing AI-generated content comprises growing share of internet text
- Research papers documenting model collapse in controlled experiments
- AI companies investing heavily in data curation and verification
- Quality degradation in AI outputs noticed by users over model generations
- Premium markets emerging for verified human-created training data
- Web scraping becoming less valuable as AI content dominates
- Adversarial examples and data poisoning attacks demonstrated in research
- AI benchmarks showing diminishing returns from larger training sets
- Investment analysts questioning AI scaling assumptions
- Major AI labs hoarding pre-AI-era datasets as strategic assets
