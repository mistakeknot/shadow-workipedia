# Global Tax System Breakdown

## Overview

Global tax system breakdown describes the collapse of territorial taxation in the face of digital economy, cryptocurrency, and capital mobility. Tax systems designed for physical presence and traceable transactions cannot cope with borderless digital commerce and privacy-preserving financial technologies.
The result is accelerating erosion of government fiscal capacity precisely as demands on public services increase. Without functioning taxation, states cannot provide the infrastructure, education, and social insurance that market economies depend on.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Digital Nomad Tax Arbitrage**: Millions of remote workers exploit tax residency rules, earning income in high-wage economies while residing in low-tax jurisdictions. Source countries lose tax base.
- **Corporate Profit Evaporation**: Digital giants shift intellectual property and profits to zero-tax jurisdictions faster than regulations adapt. Effective corporate tax rates approach zero for largest companies.
- **Cryptocurrency Tax Evasion Normalization**: Privacy coins and decentralized exchanges enable widespread tax evasion. Governments cannot track crypto wealth or enforce capital gains compliance.
- **Fiscal Capacity Collapse**: Nations dependent on corporate and capital gains taxes face shrinking revenues. Public services degrade as the tax base erodes despite growing economic activity.
- **Wealth Tax Enforcement Failure**: Attempts to tax wealth fail as assets become increasingly mobile and invisible. The ultra-wealthy exist outside any tax jurisdiction's effective reach.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Tax Base Erosion** → **Public Service Collapse**: Without tax revenue, governments cannot maintain infrastructure, healthcare, education, or social safety nets. Service quality declines drive further capital flight.
- **Fiscal Crisis** → **Debt Spiral**: Nations borrow to maintain services, accumulating unsustainable debt. Eventually debt service crowds out all discretionary spending.
- **Tax Competition** → **Race to Bottom**: Jurisdictions compete by lowering taxes, eliminating revenue for all. Coordination failures prevent collective solutions.
- **Inequality Acceleration** → **Social Fracture**: Those who can escape taxation accumulate wealth while immobile workers bear increasing burden. Social contracts collapse.

## Warning Signs

- Corporate tax revenues declining as share of GDP across OECD
- Proliferation of digital nomad visa programs
- Cryptocurrency adoption accelerating in high-tax jurisdictions
- Tax treaty frameworks failing to adapt to digital economy
- Wealthy individuals renouncing citizenship for tax purposes
- International coordination efforts (OECD minimum tax) stalling
- Growing gap between economic activity and tax revenue
