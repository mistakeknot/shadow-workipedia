# Ozone Recovery Disruption

## Overview

Ozone recovery disruption describes risks that could reverse or delay the healing of Earth's ozone layer despite the Montreal Protocol's success. The ozone layer, which protects life from harmful UV radiation, was expected to recover by mid-century, but several threats could derail this trajectory.
Illegal CFC emissions detected in recent decades demonstrate enforcement gaps in the treaty framework. More concerning, proposed stratospheric aerosol injection for climate cooling could accelerate ozone depletion through chemical interactions, creating a potential conflict between addressing warming and protecting the ozone layer. A failure to maintain ozone recovery would increase UV exposure globally, with cascading effects on human health, agriculture, and ecosystems.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **Illegal CFC Emissions Spike**: Monitoring detects significant increase in CFC-11 or other banned ozone-depleting substances, traced to illicit manufacturing despite Montreal Protocol bans.
- **Ozone Hole Expansion Anomaly**: Antarctic ozone hole expands beyond expected recovery trajectory, raising concerns about recovery timeline and unknown emission sources.
- **Geoengineering Ozone Interaction**: Stratospheric aerosol injection or other geoengineering efforts discovered to accelerate ozone depletion through chemical interactions.
- **UV Index Health Threshold Breach**: Populated regions experience sustained dangerous UV levels requiring behavioral advisories and health interventions.
- **Montreal Protocol Enforcement Failure**: International inability to identify and halt illegal emissions demonstrates limits of environmental treaty enforcement.
- **Ozone Recovery Timeline Revision**: Scientists revise ozone recovery estimates significantly later, extending period of elevated UV exposure and associated health risks.
- **Agricultural UV Damage Surge**: Increased UV-B radiation damages crops and disrupts agricultural systems in affected latitudes.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Illegal Emissions** -> **Recovery Delay**: Even small quantities of CFCs significantly delay ozone recovery. Enforcement gaps in the Montreal Protocol allow continued illicit production, pushing recovery far into the future.
- **Geoengineering Interaction** -> **Unintended Consequences**: Stratospheric aerosol injection to combat warming may accelerate ozone depletion through chemical reactions, creating trade-off between climate and ozone goals.
- **UV Increase** -> **Health Cascade**: Higher UV exposure increases skin cancer, cataracts, and immune suppression. Agricultural yields decline as UV-B damages crops and disrupts pollinator behavior.
- **Treaty Erosion** -> **Governance Crisis**: Failure to enforce the Montreal Protocol—history's most successful environmental treaty—undermines confidence in international environmental cooperation broadly.

## Warning Signs

- Atmospheric monitoring detecting unexpected CFC-11 or other ODS emissions
- Ozone hole recovery slower than model predictions
- Satellite data showing stratospheric ozone concentration anomalies
- Increased UV index readings in mid-latitude regions
- Research linking geoengineering proposals to ozone chemistry concerns
- Enforcement actions against illegal refrigerant manufacturing
- Skin cancer rates rising faster than demographic factors explain
- Agricultural damage attributed to UV exposure increasing
- Climate models incorporating ozone-geoengineering interactions
- Montreal Protocol parties expressing concern about compliance gaps
