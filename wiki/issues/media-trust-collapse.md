# Media Trust Collapse

## Overview

Public trust in traditional news institutions deteriorates as algorithmic platforms distribute misinformation faster than fact-checking can address it, while journalism's economic model collapses under digital competition. Citizens increasingly inhabit partisan information silos, creating incompatible realities that undermine shared democratic discourse and enable foreign influence operations to exploit societal divisions.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Institutional Trust**: Declines as major outlets fail or face credibility scandals; recovery requires sustained journalism quality improvements over years
- **Information Quality**: Degrades when platform algorithms prioritize engagement over accuracy; improves only through platform accountability measures and journalism funding
- **Democratic Discourse Health**: Directly correlates with media trust; polarization increases when citizens lose shared factual foundation
- **Partisan Polarization**: Accelerates as citizens retreat into algorithmic echo chambers; fragments public debate into incompatible narratives
- **Local News Viability**: Collapses in news deserts as advertising revenue migrates to digital platforms; local accountability journalism disappears

**Event Types:**
1. **Major Outlet Failure**: Established news organization shutters or experiences credibility collapse (e.g., scandal, bankruptcy), shaking public confidence in remaining institutions
2. **Algorithmic Manipulation Exposure**: Leak or investigation reveals platform algorithms systematically amplified misinformation; triggers regulatory pressure and user backlash
3. **News Desert Expansion**: Regional newspaper closes or cuts reporting significantly; community loses local investigative capacity and accountability mechanisms
4. **Journalism Bailout Debate**: Governments or tech companies propose subsidizing journalism; contentious political fight over editorial independence implications
5. **Platform Accountability Legislation**: Regulatory action forces platforms to address algorithmic amplification; varies in effectiveness depending on implementation

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Disinformation Plague** when information quality drops below threshold and trust in institutions collapses
- Amplifies **Deepfake Reality Crisis** by eroding public ability to distinguish authentic from fabricated content
- Accelerates **Democratic Backsliding** when citizens lose shared factual reality needed for meaningful electoral participation
- Compounds **Social Media Addiction Crisis** as engagement-maximizing algorithms hollow out quality journalism's economic base

## Warning Signs

- Major outlet experiences credibility scandal + Institutional Trust declines = News Desert Expansion risk
- Platform algorithm prioritizes engagement over accuracy + Partisan Polarization increases = Algorithmic Manipulation Exposure risk
- Local newspaper closures accelerate + Information Quality degrades = Democratic Discourse Health collapse
- Foreign disinformation campaigns exploit echo chambers + Trust in institutions erodes = Democratic Backsliding risk
- Journalism funding inadequate + Misinformation unchecked = Cascading failure of accountability mechanisms
