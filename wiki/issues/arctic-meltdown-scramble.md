# Arctic Meltdown Scramble

## Overview

The Arctic is warming three times faster than the global average, triggering an unprecedented scramble for resources, territory, and strategic positioning. As summer sea ice vanishes, previously inaccessible fossil fuel deposits become reachable, new shipping routes open to commerce, and geopolitical powers jostle for control—all while indigenous peoples face existential threats and massive methane releases from thawing permafrost accelerate planetary warming.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Arctic Ice Coverage** (0-100%): Primary driver of issue escalation. As coverage drops below 50%, ice-free summer declarations trigger, opening shipping routes and resource extraction zones. Below 20%, new claims become highly aggressive.
- **Resource Accessibility** (0-100): Determines how easily nations can extract oil, gas, and minerals. Increases exponentially as ice melts. Higher accessibility drives territorial competition and military buildup.
- **Geopolitical Tension** (0-100): Tracks rivalry between Arctic powers (Russia, USA/NATO, China, others). Escalates with territorial claims and military presence. Can trigger security crises if unchecked.
- **Indigenous Sovereignty** (0-100): Reflects power and voice of indigenous communities. Lower sovereignty increases forced relocations and cultural erosion. Higher sovereignty enables rights victories and consent-based development.
- **Permafrost Stability** (0-100): Measures integrity of frozen soil and methane hydrate reserves. Decline triggers methane releases, amplifying climate change and creating feedback loops. Very difficult to reverse.

**Event Types:**
1. **Ice-Free Summer Declaration**: Official announcement of ice-free Arctic summer. Triggers territorial claim escalation and shipping route opening. Major news event.
2. **Territorial Claim Escalation**: Nation submits or contests a continental shelf claim under UNCLOS. Risk of military confrontation. Can trigger Great Power Rivalry.
3. **Arctic Shipping Route Opening**: First commercial transit of Northwest or Northeast Passage. Cuts shipping times dramatically but increases polar risks and environmental exposure.
4. **Permafrost Methane Release**: Large-scale thaw releases methane and CO2. Creates feedback loops that worsen Climate Refugee Floods. Difficult to mitigate retroactively.
5. **Indigenous Rights Victory**: Indigenous communities win recognition, land rights, or meaningful consent in development decisions. Reduces forced relocations and preserves cultural knowledge.
6. **Military Buildup Escalation**: Arctic powers increase military presence, bases, or exercises. Raises geopolitical tension and accident/conflict risk.

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Great Power Rivalry Redux** when Geopolitical Tension exceeds 70% and territorial claims multiply
- Amplifies **Climate Refugee Floods** when Permafrost Stability drops below 30% (methane accelerates warming)
- Cascades into **Biodiversity Collapse** as polar ecosystems destabilize and migration corridors vanish
- Connects to **Fossil-Fuel Stranded Assets** when Resource Accessibility spikes (new extraction creates long-term capital commitments)

## Warning Signs

- Arctic Ice Coverage drops below 50% + nations contest continental shelf claims = Territorial conflicts imminent
- Permafrost Stability declining + Geopolitical Tension rising = Military escalation likely
- Resource Accessibility increasing rapidly + Indigenous Sovereignty decreasing = Forced relocations and human rights crises
- Ice-free summer declared + Multiple shipping routes opening = Economic disruption to traditional maritime industries
- Methane release events occurring + no mitigation infrastructure = Feedback loop acceleration (difficult reversal)
