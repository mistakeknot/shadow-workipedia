# Asteroid/Comet Impact Risk

## Overview

Asteroid/comet impact risk describes the existential threat from near-Earth objects (NEOs) colliding with Earth. While the probability of a civilization-ending impact in any given year is extremely low, the consequences are so catastrophic that this represents a canonical existential risk requiring active mitigation.
Past impacts show that rare events can still be civilization-shaping, including regional airbursts and larger impact-winter scenarios. Unlike other existential threats, asteroid impacts are potentially preventable with sufficient warning and technology—kinetic deflection tests demonstrate the basic concept. However, detection gaps, funding limitations, and coordination challenges leave civilization more vulnerable than necessary to a preventable catastrophe.

## Game Mechanics

### Event Types

- **NEO Detection Failure**: A significant near-Earth object is detected with insufficient warning time for deflection, revealing gaps in planetary defense surveillance systems.
- **Planetary Defense Test Failure**: A kinetic impactor or other deflection mission fails to achieve required trajectory change, demonstrating technological limitations.
- **Short Warning Impact Event**: A Tunguska-class or larger object impacts with little warning, causing regional devastation and demonstrating detection gaps.
- **Civilization-Threatening Object Detected**: A kilometer-scale object is confirmed on collision course with years of warning, triggering unprecedented international mobilization.
- **Deflection Mission Geopolitical Conflict**: Nations disagree on deflection approach, timing, or responsibility, with deflection potentially shifting impact point between countries.
- **Planetary Defense Funding Collapse**: Budget cuts defund NEO detection and deflection programs despite known risks, leaving civilization vulnerable to preventable catastrophe.
- **Extinction-Level Impact**: An extinction-scale object impacts Earth, causing immediate devastation, impact winter, and potential extinction-level consequences.

**Cascading Effects:**

- **Detection Gap** -> **Insufficient Warning**: Existing surveys miss smaller objects and long-period comets. An impact with little warning leaves no time for deflection, only evacuation of the predicted impact zone.
- **Impact** -> **Impact Winter**: Large impacts eject dust and debris into the stratosphere, blocking sunlight for months to years. Agricultural collapse can follow within a growing season.
- **Regional Impact** -> **Global Cascade**: Even sub-extinction impacts (Tunguska to Chicxulub) cause tsunamis, firestorms, and climate disruption affecting regions far from impact site.
- **Deflection Politics** -> **Coordination Failure**: Deflecting an asteroid shifts its impact point during the process. Nations may conflict over who bears residual risk, potentially delaying action past the deflection window.

## Warning Signs

- NEO survey coverage gaps leaving significant blind spots
- Planetary defense budgets declining relative to known risk
- Near-miss events revealing previously undetected objects
- Deflection technology development falling behind detection capabilities
- International coordination mechanisms for planetary defense weakening
- Long-period comet detection remaining essentially impossible
- Asteroid mining interests conflicting with deflection priorities
- False alarm events revealing public communication failures
- Scientific community warnings about funding inadequacy
- Chelyabinsk-type events demonstrating ongoing detection gaps
