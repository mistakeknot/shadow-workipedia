# Climate Refugee Floods

## Overview

Sea level rise and climate-driven disasters displace populations faster than receiving countries can absorb them. The 1951 Refugee Convention defines refugees as fleeing persecution, not environmental collapse, leaving climate migrants in legal limbo with no international protection. This creates humanitarian catastrophes, border crises, and geopolitical tensions as nations scramble to respond to flows of millions.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Border Pressure**: Increases dramatically in regions adjacent to climate-vulnerable areas
- **International Relations**: Deteriorates between sending and receiving nations
- **Humanitarian Capacity**: Overwhelmed as camps become permanent cities
- **Political Stability**: Decreases in both origin and destination countries
- **Legal Framework Legitimacy**: Declines as existing treaties prove inadequate

**Event Types:**
1. **Island Nation Evacuation**: Low-lying nation begins permanent relocation of entire population
2. **Mass Coastal Displacement**: Major city flooding triggers sudden migration of millions
3. **Refugee Camp Explosion**: Overcrowded camp experiences violence, disease outbreak, or political crisis
4. **Maritime Interdiction Crisis**: Coast guard faces impossible choice between enforcement and saving lives
5. **Climate Asylum Precedent**: Court ruling expands or restricts refugee definition for climate migrants

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Asylum System Breakdown** as legal frameworks cannot process climate-based claims
- Amplifies **Border Wall Politics** as receiving nations fortify against incoming flows
- Can lead to **Climate Insurance Collapse** when mass displacement renders regions uninsurable
- Creates pressure for **International Legal Reform** to define climate refugee status

## Warning Signs

- Sea Level Rise > 0.5m + Island Nations = Mass evacuation imminent
- Climate Disasters + Weak Receiving Capacity = Humanitarian catastrophe
- Border Militarization + Refugee Flows = Maritime death toll spike
- Legal Vacuum + Mass Displacement = International system crisis
