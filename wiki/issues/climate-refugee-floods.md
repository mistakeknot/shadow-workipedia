# Climate Refugee Floods

## Overview

Sea level rise and climate-driven disasters displace populations faster than receiving countries can absorb them. The 1951 Refugee Convention defines refugees as fleeing persecution, not environmental collapse, leaving climate migrants in legal limbo with no international protection. By 2050, current projections estimate 200-300 million climate refugees globally, with 1.2 billion people living in water-stressed regions vulnerable to displacement. Island nations like Tuvalu, Kiribati, and the Maldives face complete submersion within decades, while coastal megacities from Jakarta to Miami confront existential relocation challenges.

This creates humanitarian catastrophes, border crises, and geopolitical tensions as nations scramble to respond to flows that dwarf historical refugee movements. The 2015 Syrian crisis displaced 6.7 million; climate displacement will be 30-40 times larger. Receiving nations have resettlement capacities measured in thousands per year, not millions. This mismatch between displacement velocity and absorption capacity creates permanent border crises, militarized migration routes, and generational refugee populations with no pathway to citizenship.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Border Pressure**: Increases by +45-80% in regions adjacent to climate-vulnerable areas (Southeast Asian nations facing Bangladeshi displacement, Mediterranean Europe from North African migration). Each 100,000 arrivals per year adds +8% pressure.
- **International Relations**: Deteriorates by -25% to -60% between sending and receiving nations. Unilateral border closures impose -40% penalty; negotiated quota systems only -15%. Failed resettlement agreements impose additional -20% penalty that persists for 5+ years.
- **Humanitarian Capacity**: Overwhelmed as camps become permanent cities. Facilities designed for 50,000 temporary residents house 500,000+ for decades. Capacity strain above 150% triggers disease outbreaks (+30% mortality), resource conflicts, and institutional collapse.
- **Political Stability**: Decreases by -20% in origin countries (brain drain, economic collapse, institutional failure) and -15% in destination countries (xenophobic backlash, housing crisis, welfare strain). Refugee populations above 5% of host population trigger stability cascade.
- **Legal Framework Legitimacy**: Declines by -35% as existing treaties prove inadequate. Each rejected climate asylum case reduces international law credibility by -2%. When legitimacy falls below 40%, nations begin unilateral withdrawal from refugee conventions.

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Asylum System Breakdown** as legal frameworks cannot process climate-based claims
- Amplifies **Border Wall Politics** as receiving nations fortify against incoming flows
- Can lead to **Climate Insurance Collapse** when mass displacement renders regions uninsurable
- Creates pressure for **International Legal Reform** to define climate refugee status

## Warning Signs

**Environmental Thresholds:**
- Sea level rise exceeds 0.5m (mass displacement begins) or 1.0m (megacity evacuations commence)
- Global temperature increase passes +2.0°C threshold (displacing 150M+) or +3.0°C (displacing 500M+)
- Drought affects regions with >50M population for 5+ consecutive years (Syrian crisis triggered at 3 years)
- Glacial melt reduces freshwater availability below 1,000 m³/person/year in basins with 100M+ population (Indus, Ganges-Brahmaputra, Mekong)

**Capacity Mismatches:**
- Annual displacement exceeds 5 million while global resettlement capacity remains below 200,000/year (current UNHCR capacity: 80,000/year)
- Refugee camp populations exceed 200% design capacity in 10+ locations simultaneously
- Receiving nations with resettlement infrastructure (US, Canada, Australia, EU) reject 90%+ of climate asylum applications
- Humanitarian funding gap exceeds $20B/year (current gap: $8B, projected 2030 gap: $35B)

**Political Flashpoints:**
- 3+ nations announce unilateral withdrawal from 1951 Refugee Convention within 2-year period
- Maritime migration death toll exceeds 10,000/year on single route (Mediterranean 2015 peak: 3,771 deaths)
- Major refugee-receiving nation elects far-right government on zero-immigration platform (triggers regional cascade)
- Climate migration becomes top-3 electoral issue in 15+ nations simultaneously

**Systemic Breakdown:**
- International legal framework legitimacy falls below 35% (triggers convention collapse)
- 5+ coastal megacities (population 5M+) announce permanent relocation plans within decade
- Island nation becomes first fully evacuated sovereign state (precedent triggers acceleration)
- Climate refugees outnumber conflict refugees 3:1 globally (current ratio: 1:2, crossover projected 2035-2040)
