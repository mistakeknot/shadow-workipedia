# Climate Refugee Floods

## Overview

Sea level rise and climate-driven disasters displace populations faster than receiving countries can absorb them. The 1951 Refugee Convention defines refugees as fleeing persecution, not environmental collapse, leaving climate migrants in legal limbo with no international protection. By 2050, current projections estimate 200-300 million climate refugees globally, with 1.2 billion people living in water-stressed regions vulnerable to displacement. Island nations like Tuvalu, Kiribati, and the Maldives face complete submersion within decades, while coastal megacities from Jakarta to Miami confront existential relocation challenges.

This creates humanitarian catastrophes, border crises, and geopolitical tensions as nations scramble to respond to flows that dwarf historical refugee movements. The 2015 Syrian crisis displaced 6.7 million; climate displacement will be 30-40 times larger. Receiving nations have resettlement capacities measured in thousands per year, not millions. This mismatch between displacement velocity and absorption capacity creates permanent border crises, militarized migration routes, and generational refugee populations with no pathway to citizenship.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Border Pressure**: Increases by +45-80% in regions adjacent to climate-vulnerable areas (Southeast Asian nations facing Bangladeshi displacement, Mediterranean Europe from North African migration). Each 100,000 arrivals per year adds +8% pressure.
- **International Relations**: Deteriorates by -25% to -60% between sending and receiving nations. Unilateral border closures impose -40% penalty; negotiated quota systems only -15%. Failed resettlement agreements impose additional -20% penalty that persists for 5+ years.
- **Humanitarian Capacity**: Overwhelmed as camps become permanent cities. Facilities designed for 50,000 temporary residents house 500,000+ for decades. Capacity strain above 150% triggers disease outbreaks (+30% mortality), resource conflicts, and institutional collapse.
- **Political Stability**: Decreases by -20% in origin countries (brain drain, economic collapse, institutional failure) and -15% in destination countries (xenophobic backlash, housing crisis, welfare strain). Refugee populations above 5% of host population trigger stability cascade.
- **Legal Framework Legitimacy**: Declines by -35% as existing treaties prove inadequate. Each rejected climate asylum case reduces international law credibility by -2%. When legitimacy falls below 40%, nations begin unilateral withdrawal from refugee conventions.

**Event Types:**

1. **Island Nation Evacuation**: Triggered when sea level rise exceeds 1.5m + storm surge events make inhabited land uninhabitable. Affects 11 million people in Pacific and Indian Ocean island nations. Evacuation unfolds over 5-10 years with negotiations for resettlement treaties. Tuvalu (11,000 people) negotiates relocation to Australia/New Zealand; Kiribati (120,000) faces complete absorption by neighboring nations. Each evacuation costs $50,000-150,000 per person for relocation, legal status, and integration support. Failed negotiations leave populations stateless.

2. **Mass Coastal Displacement**: Triggered by Category 5+ storms, 1-in-100-year flood events, or catastrophic infrastructure failure in coastal megacities. Jakarta (10 million), Lagos (15 million), Dhaka (22 million), and Miami (6 million) face existential risk. A single event displaces 1-5 million over weeks. Regional variation: Asian megacities lack relocation infrastructure (95% displaced remain within 100km, overwhelming regional capacity); Western cities have evacuation plans but inadequate permanent housing (40% become long-term displaced). Each event triggers insurance industry collapse in affected region (-$100B+ in claims).

3. **Refugee Camp Explosion**: Triggered when camp population exceeds 200% design capacity + resource shortfalls (water below 15L/person/day, food below 2,100 kcal/day). Probability scales with duration: 5% per year at 150% capacity, 25% per year at 300% capacity. Outcomes include: cholera outbreaks (mortality 5-15%), inter-ethnic violence (100-1,000 deaths), mass breakouts (refugees disperse into host country, triggering crackdowns), or host government forcibly closes camp (displacing residents, collapsing regional humanitarian cooperation -40%).

4. **Maritime Interdiction Crisis**: Triggered when maritime migration routes exceed 10,000 crossings/month + receiving nation implements zero-tolerance policy. Mediterranean route (Libya to Italy) and Bay of Bengal route (Myanmar to Indonesia) most volatile. Coast guards face operational dilemma: enforce borders (increasing death toll by +300% as smugglers use riskier routes) or conduct rescues (creating pull factor that increases crossings +50%). Each crisis generates 2,000-5,000 deaths/year and imposes -25% penalty to international humanitarian cooperation.

5. **Climate Asylum Precedent**: Triggered by high-profile court case where climate migrant seeks refugee status under expanded interpretation. Success probability: 15% in European courts, 8% in US, 35% in New Zealand/Pacific nations. Positive precedent opens floodgates: legal recognition increases applications by +400% over 2 years, granting refugee status to estimated 5-15 million. Negative precedent forecloses legal pathway, increasing irregular migration +60% and smuggling industry revenue +$12B/year. Regional variation: Pacific nations recognize climate refugees first (2025-2030), Europe fragments (Nordic states accept, Eastern Europe rejects), US refuses recognition until 2040+.

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Asylum System Breakdown** as legal frameworks cannot process climate-based claims
- Amplifies **Border Wall Politics** as receiving nations fortify against incoming flows
- Can lead to **Climate Insurance Collapse** when mass displacement renders regions uninsurable
- Creates pressure for **International Legal Reform** to define climate refugee status

## Warning Signs

**Environmental Thresholds:**
- Sea level rise exceeds 0.5m (mass displacement begins) or 1.0m (megacity evacuations commence)
- Global temperature increase passes +2.0°C threshold (displacing 150M+) or +3.0°C (displacing 500M+)
- Drought affects regions with >50M population for 5+ consecutive years (Syrian crisis triggered at 3 years)
- Glacial melt reduces freshwater availability below 1,000 m³/person/year in basins with 100M+ population (Indus, Ganges-Brahmaputra, Mekong)

**Capacity Mismatches:**
- Annual displacement exceeds 5 million while global resettlement capacity remains below 200,000/year (current UNHCR capacity: 80,000/year)
- Refugee camp populations exceed 200% design capacity in 10+ locations simultaneously
- Receiving nations with resettlement infrastructure (US, Canada, Australia, EU) reject 90%+ of climate asylum applications
- Humanitarian funding gap exceeds $20B/year (current gap: $8B, projected 2030 gap: $35B)

**Political Flashpoints:**
- 3+ nations announce unilateral withdrawal from 1951 Refugee Convention within 2-year period
- Maritime migration death toll exceeds 10,000/year on single route (Mediterranean 2015 peak: 3,771 deaths)
- Major refugee-receiving nation elects far-right government on zero-immigration platform (triggers regional cascade)
- Climate migration becomes top-3 electoral issue in 15+ nations simultaneously

**Systemic Breakdown:**
- International legal framework legitimacy falls below 35% (triggers convention collapse)
- 5+ coastal megacities (population 5M+) announce permanent relocation plans within decade
- Island nation becomes first fully evacuated sovereign state (precedent triggers acceleration)
- Climate refugees outnumber conflict refugees 3:1 globally (current ratio: 1:2, crossover projected 2035-2040)
