# AI Job Displacement Tsunami

## Overview

Artificial intelligence and automation technologies eliminate jobs faster than new roles can be created, triggering mass unemployment across sectors previously considered "safe." White-collar professions, creative industries, and service jobs all face disruption, concentrating wealth among AI owners while leaving billions economically stranded.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Employment Rate**: Decreases sharply in affected sectors
- **Economic Inequality**: Increases dramatically as AI profits concentrate
- **Social Stability**: Decreases with rising unemployment
- **Education Value**: Declines as credentials become obsolete faster than debt can be repaid
- **Political Polarization**: Increases as displaced workers seek radical solutions

**Event Types:**
1. **Sector Automation Wave**: An industry experiences rapid AI adoption, triggering layoffs
2. **White Collar Collapse**: Professional services (legal, accounting, medical diagnostics) face sudden displacement
3. **Retraining Failure**: Government programs fail to keep pace with displacement speed
4. **AI Productivity Boom**: GDP rises while employment falls, creating political tension
5. **Labor Unrest**: Mass protests demand protection from automation or AI taxation

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Gig Economy Serfdom** as displaced workers accept precarious platform work
- Amplifies **Student Debt Slavery** when degrees become worthless faster than loans can be repaid
- Can lead to **Mental Health Apocalypse** as mass unemployment destroys purpose and identity
- Creates pressure for **Universal Basic Income Trials** as traditional welfare proves inadequate

## Warning Signs

- Rising Productivity + Flat/Declining Employment = Automation displacement beginning
- High Inequality + Low Social Mobility = Political radicalization risk
- Rapid AI Investment + Weak Safety Nets = Social crisis imminent
- Education Debt + Credential Devaluation = Generational despair
