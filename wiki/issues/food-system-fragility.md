# Food System Fragility

## Overview

The global food system has become increasingly fragile due to intensive monoculture practices, fertilizer dependency, centralized supply chains, and climate volatility. A cascading failure in any critical node—from seed supply to distribution networks—threatens widespread hunger and geopolitical instability.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Food Security**: Directly reduced by monoculture adoption, soil degradation, and harvest failures; improved by agricultural diversification and local food systems
- **Agricultural Resilience**: Decreases with fertilizer dependency and patent restrictions on seeds; strengthened by regenerative practices and crop diversity
- **Price Volatility**: Spikes during export bans, fertilizer shortages, and harvest failures; exacerbated by financial speculation on commodity futures
- **Farmer Viability**: Eroded by seed patents, input costs, and price crashes; stabilized by fair trade and government support programs
- **Soil Health**: Degrades with intensive monoculture and chemical inputs; recovers slowly with crop rotation and organic practices

**Event Types:**
1. **Harvest Failure**: Regional crop loss due to drought, pest outbreak, or disease; triggers price spikes and food shortages
2. **Fertilizer Shortage**: Supply chain disruption reduces nutrient availability; pushes farmers toward unsustainable alternatives
3. **Export Ban Cascade**: Crisis response by major producers creates panic buying and regional shortages
4. **Seed Patent Crisis**: Legal enforcement prevents farmer seed saving; reduces genetic diversity and farmer autonomy
5. **Pollinator Collapse**: Bee/insect die-off reduces crop pollination; directly impacts fruit and vegetable yields
6. **Soil Degradation Threshold**: Cumulative damage reaches point where yields drop sharply despite increased inputs

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Water Scarcity Wars** when irrigation demands exceed water availability during droughts
- Triggers **Climate Refugee Floods** when sustained crop failures cause mass migration
- Triggers **Supply Chain Fragility** through fertilizer and seed dependencies on fragmented global networks
- Triggers **Factory Farming Fallout** as industrial consolidation increases vulnerability to single-point failures
- Amplified by **Economic Inequality** when rising food costs push vulnerable populations into hunger

## Warning Signs

- **Monoculture + Climate Instability** = Widespread harvest failures
- **Patent Enforcement + Fertilizer Dependency** = Farmer debt spirals and consolidation
- **Soil Degradation + Intensive Inputs** = Diminishing returns and ecological collapse
- **Export Concentration + Geopolitical Tension** = Trade ban risks and regional shortages
- **Pollinator Decline + Crop Diversity Loss** = Hidden vulnerability in staple crops
- **Financial Speculation + Price Controls** = Whipsaw volatility and hoarding behaviors
