# School Shooting Epidemic

## Overview

The United States faces an unprecedented epidemic of gun violence in schools, a crisis that has normalized active shooter drills alongside math lessons and recess. Since Columbine High School in 1999, over 300 school shootings have occurred on American campuses, leaving nearly 200 dead and over 700 wounded. Children across the nation practice "lockdown drills"—hiding under desks, silencing phones, holding their breath—as routine preparation for potential mass casualty events. This is not normal in other developed democracies; it is uniquely American.

The psychological toll on an entire generation cannot be overstated. Students report chronic anxiety, hypervigilance, and trauma responses to fire alarms or fire drills that echo active shooter scenarios. Teachers grapple with the moral injury of being asked to serve as first responders and potential human shields for their students. Parents send their children to school each morning with an unstated understanding that tragedy could strike. From Parkland to Uvalde to Covenant School in Nashville, each mass shooting reopens national wounds while survivors become advocates, politicians express thoughts and prayers, and the cycle repeats.

Despite supermajority public support for evidence-based prevention measures—universal background checks, extreme risk protection orders, secure storage laws—political paralysis persists. The gun lobby's influence, constitutional absolutism, and the fragmentation of America's civic consensus have created a regulatory vacuum where school safety depends on metal detectors, armed guards, hardened classrooms, and the hope that tragedy won't strike today. The cost is measured not just in lives lost, but in the erosion of childhood itself: a generation growing up in a state of preparedness for something that should never be normalized.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects

- **Gun Ownership Rate** (0-100): Each 10-point increase raises school shooting probability by 0-3%. Secondary effect: increases militia organizing and armed civilian intervention incidents.
- **Mental Health Access** (-50 to +50): Each 10-point decrease raises threat escalation probability by 1-2%. Insufficient mental health services correlate with crisis intervention failures.
- **School Security Spending** (0-100): Each 10-point increase reduces casualty counts by 10-15% when incidents occur, but increases militarization perception and student anxiety. Diminishing returns after 60 points.
- **Gun Regulation Strength** (-50 to +50): Each 10-point increase reduces school shooting frequency by 3-5%. Extreme risk protection orders particularly effective (15-20% reduction).
- **Social Cohesion Index** (-50 to +50): Each 10-point decrease increases isolation-driven incidents by 2-3%. School bullying and social fragmentation become upstream indicators.

### Cascading Effects

- **Trauma Contagion**: Each school shooting event increases anxiety disorder diagnoses district-wide by 15-30% over following 12 months, persisting 3-5 years. Compounds across multiple incidents within region.
- **Teacher Exodus**: School violence events trigger 5-10% teacher turnover in affected schools (beyond normal attrition). Replacement teachers are often under-qualified, reducing education quality for 2-3 years.
- **Emergency Militarization**: Increased security spending normalizes police presence in schools, correlating with 20-40% increase in school-based arrests for minor infractions, particularly affecting Black and Latino students.
- **Political Deadlock**: Supermajority public support for evidence measures (85%+) paradoxically correlates with legislative failure (Senate filibuster, state-level blocking). Creates public trust erosion in democratic institutions.
- **International Recruitment**: School shooting events are amplified by international media, increasing radicalization recruitment targeting of socially isolated youth in other nations seeking to emulate attacks.

## Warning Signs

- **Threat Assessment Surge**: Spike in reported threats, concerning social media posts, and concerning behavior reports. May indicate increasing social fragmentation or improved detection systems.
- **School Security Contractor Growth**: Rapid expansion of armed security, surveillance systems, and threat assessment consulting indicates institutional panic and willingness to accept militarization trade-offs.
- **Substitute Teacher Shortages**: Inability to fill classroom positions signals teacher exodus from affected districts due to trauma and safety concerns.
- **Active Shooter Drill Frequency Increase**: Schools escalating drill realism and frequency (monthly vs. annual) indicates elevated threat perception and potential over-response contributing to student anxiety.
- **Survivor Advocacy Organization Formation**: Post-incident creation of student-led advocacy groups like March for Our Lives indicates mobilization window; correlates with 3-6 month legislative opportunity before momentum fades.
- **Gun Sales Spike Around Schools**: Increases in firearms purchases near school districts correlates with homeschooling migration (2-5% annually) and private school growth, fragmenting public education.
