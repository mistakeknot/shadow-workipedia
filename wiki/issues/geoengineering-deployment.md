# Geoengineering Deployment

## Overview

Solar radiation management (SRM)—also known as geoengineering—represents humanity's most dangerous climate gamble: the deliberate manipulation of Earth's radiation balance through methods like stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), marine cloud brightening, or high-altitude mirrors. When global temperatures become intolerable and carbon removal technologies fail to scale, pressure mounts to "just cool the planet" through technological intervention. Yet deployment triggers cascading crises: unilateral action by one power bloc triggers counter-deployments by rivals, creating competing climate zones with incompatible precipitation patterns. Regions optimized for current agriculture suddenly face different monsoons, altered water cycles, and unexpected ecological disruptions. The deepest danger emerges not in deployment, but in *stopping*—the termination shock. Once billions of people depend on maintained geoengineering to avoid catastrophic warming, removing it becomes geopolitically impossible. Any power can threaten to halt deployment to extort political concessions, weaponizing the climate itself. Governance frameworks that might prevent this catastrophe do not exist and have not been negotiated. Scientists lose credibility as the public cannot distinguish between natural weather, intentional modification, and blame-shifting from competing powers. Geoengineering transforms from climate solution into a civilization-scale trap.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Global Mean Temperature (°C)**: Decreases 0.5–3.0°C depending on deployment scale; SRM creates regional temperature asymmetries of ±4–5°C, with some regions warming while others cool
- **Precipitation Patterns (Regional, %)**: Monsoons weaken 15–40% under heavy SAI; jet stream shifts alter Atlantic storm tracks and Pacific typhoon intensities; some regions gain water security while others face unprecedented drought
- **Atmospheric Optical Depth**: Increases with continuous aerosol injection; higher optical depth = more diffuse sunlight, reducing direct radiation by 10–25% and altering plant photosynthesis and solar panel efficiency
- **Governance Legitimacy (0–100)**: Plummets 20–40 points per unilateral unannounced SRM deployment; international trust collapses as nations perceive unilateral climate weaponization
- **Termination Shock Risk (0–100)**: Increases exponentially with SRM deployment duration; after 10 years of active deployment, abrupt cessation triggers 0.8–2.0°C warming over 3–5 years, causing massive crop failures and resource wars
- **Agricultural Productivity (regional %)**: Highly variable—some regions see +8–15% gains under cooler, diffuse-light conditions; others lose 20–35% due to altered precipitation, weakened monsoons, or reduced water availability
- **Research Credibility (Science, 0–100)**: Declines 15–30 points per major unattributed climate anomaly blamed on SRM; attribution failure metastasizes into conspiracy theories and denial movements
- **Economic Inequality (0–100)**: Increases 25–40 points as wealthy nations gain SRM access while developing nations suffer precipitation disruptions; geoengineering becomes yet another wealth-dependent survival tool

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Climate Refugee Crisis** when altered precipitation patterns render agricultural regions uninhabitable; billions displaced by SRM-induced water stress rather than direct warming
- Amplifies **Aerosol Geoengineering Proxy War** by 60–100% when competing SRM deployments create regional conflicts; geoengineering becomes militarized technology
- Exacerbates **Climate Governance Failure** as nations race to unilateral SRM rather than coordinate emissions reductions; international agreements become advisory only
- Creates feedback loops with **Agricultural Collapse** when monsoon-dependent regions face synchronized weakening from multiple competing SRM campaigns; global food security becomes hostage to geoengineering stability
- Destabilizes **International Relations** as geoengineering access becomes marker of great-power status; non-aligned nations forced to choose alignment based on SRM access
- Risks **Termination Shock Crisis** when deployment becomes self-perpetuating; any attempt to reduce SRM triggers political blackmail and potential warfare

## Warning Signs

- **Global Temperature Acceleration + Policy Deadlock** = Major SRM deployment likely within 5–8 years if emissions continue and adaptation costs spiral
- **Extreme Heat Waves + Agricultural Losses + Weak International Consensus** = Conditions ripe for unilateral "emergency" SRM deployment without international agreement
- **Great-Power Climate Asymmetry**: Regions with incompatible climate preferences (some wanting cooler, drier conditions; others wanting warmer, wetter) increases deployment probability by 3–5x
- **Military Interest in Geoengineering R&D**: Armed forces beginning to treat SRM as strategic asset rather than climate tool; weaponization framework emerging in military doctrine
- **Weak International Governance + Rapid SRM Tech Development** = Attribution detection becoming impossible; verification regimes cannot keep pace with deployment speed
- **Visible SRM Effects on Precipitation**: If one nation's SRM deployment demonstrably shifts monsoons or alters river systems in neighboring countries, retaliatory counter-deployment follows within 12–24 months
- **Termination Shock Rhetoric Entering Policy Debates** = Political leaders openly discussing SRM-induced dependencies and weaponization scenarios; deterrence framework crystallizing
- **Climate Scientist Credibility Crisis + Attribution Uncertainty** = Public unable to distinguish SRM effects from natural climate variability; conspiracy theories metastasize; policy-making paralyzed

## Technical Realism & Governance Gaps

**Why SRM Becomes Irresistible:**
- Cost: ~$3–15 billion annually for 1–2°C cooling (cheaper than major emissions reduction infrastructure or massive adaptation investments)
- Speed: Measurable effects within weeks (vs. 30–50 years for CO₂ reduction or carbon removal)
- Reversibility (theoretical): Aerosol deposition rates clear upper atmosphere in 1–2 years if injection stops
- Addresses urgency: Gives immediate political cover during climate crises when public demands action
- BUT: Regional side effects remain fundamentally unpredictable; monsoons cannot be surgically cooled; benefits and harms distributed catastrophically unequal across nations

**Why Governance is Impossible:**
- **No treaty framework**: UN climate negotiations treat SRM as taboo—acknowledging its necessity implies emissions reduction has failed
- **Verification impossibility**: Detecting and quantifying SRM deployment is physics-hard; no way to prove a nation deployed 5,000 tons vs. 10,000 tons of aerosols
- **Attribution certainty unavailable**: Climate scientists cannot definitively link specific anomalies to specific SRM deployments; blame-shifting becomes infinite
- **Deployment asymmetry**: SRM can be conducted secretly from remote altitudes; detection requires satellite constellation, ground networks, and international cooperation that won't exist
- **Military separation**: Military geoengineering development completely unlinked from civilian oversight; dual-use technology pathways uncontrolled
- **Competitive pressure**: First mover advantage in SRM dominance incentivizes unilateral deployment before international agreements crystallize

**Termination Shock as Permanent Lock-in:**
- Once SRM runs for 15+ years, global agriculture, water infrastructure, and population distributions all adapt to SRM-maintained climate
- Agricultural genetics, soil ecosystems, water management systems become optimized for cooler, different precipitation patterns
- Abrupt cessation triggers 0.5–2.0°C warming within 3–5 years; crops fail; water systems dry up; infrastructure designed for SAI climate collapses
- Creates permanent leverage: Any SRM-capable power can threaten withdrawal to coerce political concessions
- Escape route doesn't exist: Humanity trapped in perpetual geoengineering dependence; climate itself becomes hostage to technological maintenance and geopolitical negotiation

## Example Scenarios

**Unilateral Deployment**: Indian monsoons weaken 28% due to warming. Maldives requests UN-backed emergency SRM. US-EU coalition backs deployment; India announces protective counter-deployment; China joins India's program. Three simultaneous SAI deployments with conflicting objectives create atmospheric interference, destabilize jet streams, and trigger attribution battles over who caused West African Sahel drought.

**Termination Shock Coercion**: After 10 years of SRM cooling global temperatures 1.4°C, US-China conflict escalates over Taiwan. China demands US cede Pacific military presence in exchange for continued SAI cooperation. US threatens to halt western SRM deployment, knowing termination shock will devastate Chinese agriculture. Climate becomes strategic weapon; grain markets freeze; nuclear powers nearly clash over geoengineering command infrastructure.

**Infrastructure Sabotage**: Coordinated cyber and kinetic strikes against SRM aircraft and control networks reduce aerosol loading 40% within 2 weeks. Previously cooled regions warm 0.8–1.2°C within 30–60 days; crops adapted to SAI conditions wilt. Attribution crisis follows as multiple actors claim responsibility. SRM nations mobilize military to protect remaining infrastructure; hybrid warfare escalates.
