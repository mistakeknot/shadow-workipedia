# Algorithmic Discrimination

## Overview

As algorithmic systems increasingly mediate critical decisions in hiring, lending, criminal justice, and healthcare, the embedded biases in training data and model design perpetuate and amplify historical discrimination. The lack of transparency, explainability, and accountability creates a system where discriminatory outcomes are difficult to detect, challenge, or remedy.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Systemic Inequality**: Higher algorithmic discrimination increases existing social stratification. Biased hiring algorithms reduce social mobility for disadvantaged groups, deepening wealth gaps.
- **Algorithmic Transparency**: Increased transparency pressure makes discrimination harder to hide but can trigger defensive corporate responses and regulatory backlash.
- **Legal Accountability**: Stronger accountability frameworks create liability risks for companies, driving investment in bias detection and mitigation—or, if too burdensome, incentivizing algorithm replacement with less regulated human decision-making.
- **Trust in Technology**: Public scandals erode trust in AI systems, slowing adoption of beneficial technologies and increasing demand for algorithmic explainability.
- **Social Mobility**: Discriminatory algorithms in credit scoring, hiring, and education track individuals into predetermined economic paths, reducing opportunities for advancement.

**Event Types:**
1. **Bias Scandal Exposure**: A major algorithm (facial recognition, hiring, credit scoring) is revealed to discriminate systematically. Public outcry and media pressure force corporate response.
2. **Algorithmic Audit Mandate**: Governments mandate third-party audits of algorithms in critical sectors (criminal justice, employment, lending). Companies must disclose model performance across demographic groups.
3. **Discriminatory Lending Lawsuit**: Marginalized groups sue lenders whose algorithms deny loans at higher rates than white borrowers. Settlement creates legal precedent for algorithmic discrimination liability.
4. **Predictive Policing Ban**: Cities ban algorithmic systems used to predict crime locations or offender risk, citing evidence of racial discrimination. Law enforcement retrains officers or returns to traditional methods.
5. **AI Ethics Board Formation**: Major tech companies establish ethics boards with external oversight to review high-impact algorithms for fairness. Some boards gain real power; others become PR cover.

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **AI Job Displacement Tsunami** when algorithmic hiring becomes standard without fairness constraints, replacing human judgment with biased automation.
- Triggers **Surveillance State Creep** when predictive policing and algorithmic monitoring expand into communities disproportionately targeted by discriminatory systems.
- Triggers **Democratic Backsliding** when algorithmic discrimination in voter suppression tools or misinformation targeting undermines electoral integrity.
- Triggers **Housing Impossibility Crisis** when rental algorithms and mortgage underwriting algorithms systematically deny housing to protected classes, concentrating disadvantage geographically.

## Warning Signs

- Algorithmic system deployed in high-stakes decision (hiring, lending, criminal justice) without bias testing = **Discrimination risk**
- Biased training data + Lack of diverse representation in model builders = **Systemic amplification**
- Opaque algorithm + Difficult appeals process = **Accountability gap**
- Mounting bias scandals + Weak regulatory response = **Erosion of public trust**
- Algorithmic discrimination increases + Social mobility declines = **Entrenched inequality**
