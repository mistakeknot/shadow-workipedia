# Universal Basic Income Trials

## Overview

Pilot programs distributing unconditional cash payments to all citizens challenge fundamental assumptions about work, welfare, and economic security. Recipients in Finland, Kenya, and Stockton thrive while maintaining stable work patterns, but inflation panic and funding debates over wealth taxes versus automation taxes expose deep ideological divides about how society should respond to technological displacement.

## Game Mechanics

**Parameter Effects:**
- **Poverty Rate**: Decreases in pilot regions as unconditional income provides floor
- **Work Participation**: Remains stable contrary to predictions, challenging assumptions
- **Political Polarization**: Increases as universality versus means testing divides intensify
- **Public Trust in Government**: Fluctuates based on program design (universal builds trust, means testing erodes it)
- **Innovation Rate**: Increases as basic security enables entrepreneurial risk-taking

**Event Types:**
1. **Pilot Success Evidence**: Trial data shows recipients thriving, work patterns stable, health improving
2. **Inflation Panic**: Price increases blamed on UBI despite lack of causal evidence
3. **Funding Crisis**: Political deadlock over wealth tax, automation tax, or carbon dividend mechanisms
4. **Means Testing Battle**: Universal versus targeted payment debate exposes fundamental values conflicts
5. **Libertarian-Progressive Split**: Strange bedfellows coalition fractures over implementation details

**Cascading Effects:**
- Triggers **Automation Tax Wars** as funding debates intensify over who pays for UBI
- Amplifies **Billionaire Abolition Movement** when wealth concentration makes taxation politically viable
- Can lead to **Social Credit Capitalism** if UBI gets tied to behavioral requirements
- Creates pressure for **AI Job Displacement Tsunami** mitigation as automation accelerates

## Warning Signs

- High Automation + Weak Safety Nets = UBI political necessity
- Pilot Success + Inflation Fears = Evidence versus ideology conflict
- Rising Inequality + Funding Debates = Implementation gridlock
- Universal Support + Means Testing Demands = Program failure through compromise
