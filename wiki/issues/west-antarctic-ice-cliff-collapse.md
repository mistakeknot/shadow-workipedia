## Overview

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) represents one of Earth's most destabilized ice masses, covering an area roughly the size of Texas with ice up to 4 kilometers thick. What makes it uniquely vulnerable is its "marine-based" geology—the bedrock beneath much of the ice sheet sits below sea level, sloping downward from the coast toward the interior. This configuration creates the potential for a catastrophic runaway collapse scenario known as marine ice cliff instability (MICI). As global ocean temperatures rise, warm water penetrates beneath floating ice shelves that act as buttresses, destabilizing and accelerating the discharge of ice into the ocean. Once these ice shelves thin or collapse entirely, the grounded ice cliffs above them lose crucial support. If these cliffs exceed roughly 900 meters in height, they become mechanically unstable and can collapse catastrophically—a process that could unleash meters of sea level rise within decades rather than centuries.

The West Antarctic Ice Sheet currently contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by approximately 3.3 meters. Recent satellite observations show alarming acceleration: the Thwaites Glacier, often called the "doomsday glacier," has been retreating at accelerating rates and losing over 50 billion tons of ice annually. The grounding line—where the glacier transitions from sitting on bedrock to floating on water—is retreating toward deeper and deeper bedrock, a geometry that paradoxically makes collapse self-reinforcing. Once retreat begins in earnest, warmer water reaches progressively deeper ice, causing faster melting and further grounding line retreat. Computer models suggest that if ocean temperatures continue warming as projected, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could enter a period of irreversible collapse within the next few decades, potentially crossing a critical tipping point from which recovery becomes impossible even if temperatures later cool.

The human consequences would be staggering. A 3-meter sea level rise would flood major coastal cities from New York to London to Shanghai, displace hundreds of millions of people, eliminate vast areas of agricultural land, contaminate freshwater aquifers with saltwater intrusion, and render entire island nations uninhabitable. Port cities housing billions of people and trillions in infrastructure would face existential threats. The economic disruption would cascade through global supply chains, insurance markets, and financial systems. Unlike gradual climate changes that societies can adapt to incrementally, MICI represents a potential abrupt shift—a tipping point where the pace of change outstrips human capacity to respond, leaving coastal civilizations no alternative but retreat into geographically compressed inland regions, triggering unprecedented forced migration and resource competition at a civilizational scale.

## Game Mechanics

### Parameter Effects
- **Sea Level Rise Rate**: +80 (accelerating coastal flooding)
- **Coastal Infrastructure**: -70 (ports, cities at risk)
- **Insurance Markets**: -60 (coastal property uninsurable)
- **Climate Migration Pressure**: +75 (hundreds of millions displaced)

## Cascading Effects

Antarctic ice collapse triggers:
- **Pacific Island Nations Disappearing**: Low-lying atoll nations become uninhabitable within years, triggering sovereignty and climate justice crises
- **Climate Refugee Floods**: Coastal populations forced inland, overwhelming inland capacity and triggering mass migration pressure
- **Insurance Collapse**: Coastal zones become uninsurable, stranding property owners and creating financial system instability

## Warning Signs

- Thwaites Glacier grounding line retreat acceleration (currently ~500 m/year)
- Pine Island Glacier flow rate increases and acceleration patterns
- Ocean warming reaching ice sheet bases (warm water intrusion rates)
- Satellite detection of rapid ice mass loss (>100 billion tons/year)
- Increased calving events and ice shelf thinning rates
- Bedrock geometry observations revealing retreat-amplification geometry
