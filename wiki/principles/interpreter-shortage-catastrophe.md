# Interpreter Shortage Catastrophe

Only 10,000 certified ASL interpreters serve 500,000+ Deaf Americans requiring interpretation for medical appointments, legal proceedings, employment, and education—creating 1:50+ ratios that guarantee access denial for routine needs and impossible coverage for emergencies; interpreter burnout rates exceed 40% annually as demand outpaces training pipeline by 3:1.
