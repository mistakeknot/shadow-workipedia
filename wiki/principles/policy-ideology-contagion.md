# Policy Ideology Contagion

Government responses cluster by ideology (Technocrats 85% fast-track infrastructure, Democratic Socialists 90% public ownership, National Conservatives 85% export controls, Environmental Justice 80% moratoria) with neighbor policy observation creating 40% weight contagion (California moratorium → Oregon/Washington follow 1-2 years) and successful outcomes amplifying spread while failures discredit approaches.
