# Multi Factor Threat Multiplicative

Threat levels emerge from multiplicative combination of military power ratio, geographic proximity (neighbors = 1.0, distant = 0.1), and existing tension (1.0 + diplomatic tension 0.0-2.0), with threat threshold >1.5 triggering strategic response and no single factor dominating, creating emergent threat patterns from interaction effects.
