# OT IT Convergence Attack Surface Explosion

Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) cloud-connected platforms bridge air gap between operational technology (OT) physical processes and information technology (IT) networks creating attack vectors where vendor backdoors (undisclosed remote access 40-60% platforms), zero-day exploits (Stuxnet-precedent), credential theft (phishing success rate 10-30% OT engineers), supply chain compromise (malicious firmware updates) enable kill switch attacks (emergency stop, remote shutdown, firmware lockout, credential revocation) with immature detection (OT intrusion detection systems 20-40% maturity vs IT 70-90%) creating false positive vs production disruption dilemma (10% false positive rate = monthly shutdowns) where segmentation tradeoffs air-gapped (eliminate remote attacks, sacrifice real-time monitoring quality control/predictive maintenance) vs firewalled (reduce attack surface 50-70%, partial monitoring) vs cloud-connected (full attack surface, full monitoring) lock countries into efficiency-security paradox where 20-50% slower manual override production penalties make automation economically mandatory despite catastrophic vulnerability.
