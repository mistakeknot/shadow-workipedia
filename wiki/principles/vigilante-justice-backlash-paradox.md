# Vigilante Justice Backlash Paradox

Death penalty abolition states experience vigilante justice probability 1.5× higher than retention states (0.3% vs 0.2% annual for murder acquittals) where victim family rage (0.0-1.0 based on heinousness + media attention) drives extrajudicial killings → public sympathy for vigilantes → death penalty support rebounds +5% to +15% temporarily → creates political paradox where abolition success triggers backlash via perception that "justice system failed" → demands for death penalty restoration → but legislative reversal never succeeds (0% reinstatement rate historically) → frustration intensifies driving continued vigilante incidents in feedback loop.
