# Natural Soundscape Extinction Recording Preservation Loss

Natural quiet (<20 dB) increasingly rare → 83% of US land area has doubled background noise from anthropogenic sources → wilderness acoustic refugia shrinking → dawn chorus recordings now historic documents → ocean soundscape transformed by shipping → archive of soundscapes becoming extinction record → bioacoustic monitoring reveals disappearing species before visual surveys → acoustic heritage loss parallels biodiversity loss.
