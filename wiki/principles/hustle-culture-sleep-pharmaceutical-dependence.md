# Hustle Culture Sleep Pharmaceutical Dependence

Sleep=weakness narrative normalization → average sleep 7.5hr→6hr→5hr (2000→2024→2040) → Ambien/Lunesta dependence >30% adults 2030 → rebound insomnia trap (cannot sleep without drugs) → chronic exhaustion → cognitive decline → health cascade (cardiovascular, metabolic, cancer) (sleep debt becomes permanent, pharmaceutical crutch creates worse problem, population chronically exhausted)
