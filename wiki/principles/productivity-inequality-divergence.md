# Productivity Inequality Divergence

Automation increases productivity (+80%) while reducing labor income share (-50%), concentrating gains in capital owners and driving wealth inequality (Gini coefficient rise) when automation rate exceeds 30% combined with structural unemployment >25%, triggering political intervention only after 15-25% threshold creates 5-10 year policy lag.
