# Downtown Abandonment Foot Traffic Collapse

Office workers remote → downtown foot traffic -40% to -60% → retail/restaurant viability threshold broken → business closures 25% annually → vacancy rises (15-20% baseline → 30-50% crisis) → crime narrative weaponization (media coverage + political polarization) whether empirically true or perception-driven → capital flight accelerates → more businesses exit → "unsafe downtown" perception entrenches → when foot traffic falls >40% AND retail vacancy exceeds 30% the abandonment spiral becomes self-reinforcing creating permanent downtown hollowing.
