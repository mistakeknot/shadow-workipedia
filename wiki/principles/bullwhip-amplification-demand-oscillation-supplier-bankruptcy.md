# Bullwhip Amplification Demand Oscillation Supplier Bankruptcy

Supply chain stages amplify small demand changes exponentially where 10% consumer increase (buy extra "just in case") cascades through retail (+25%), distributor (+50%), manufacturer (+100%), supplier (+200%) creating massive overproduction, then reverses when demand normalizes (-5% consumer) through retail cancellations (-30%), distributor dumping (-60%), manufacturer idling (-80%), supplier bankruptcies as whiplash from feast-to-famine destroys capacity.
