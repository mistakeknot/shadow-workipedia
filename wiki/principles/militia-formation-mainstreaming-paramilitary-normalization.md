# Militia Formation Mainstreaming Paramilitary Normalization

Militia groups proliferate from 300 active US groups (2010) to 1,000+ (2025) with membership 40,000-100,000 as paramilitary organizations mainstream through open recruitment, public training, and electoral participation, where 30-40% Americans view armed groups positively (vs <10% historical) and militia presence at protests/elections normalizes political violence as acceptable tactic, creating paramilitary normalization where 50-100 active combat-trained irregular units exist across democracies by 2030-2035 capable of sustained violent operations once political trigger occurs.
