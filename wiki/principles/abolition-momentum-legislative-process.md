# Abolition Momentum Legislative Process

State-by-state abolition follows multi-stage legislative process where committee passage 60% probability (progressive chairs) → floor vote 70% (moderate swing votes) → governor signature conditional on ideology (liberal governors 95%, moderate 40%, conservative 5%) → abolition drivers compound (public support <50% baseline, exoneration events +15%, botched executions +25%, fiscal costs $1.26M premium argument) → once abolished, reversal structurally impossible (no state has reinstated after abolition) creating one-way ratchet toward nationwide abolition despite regional resistance (Southern states maintain 80% local support).
