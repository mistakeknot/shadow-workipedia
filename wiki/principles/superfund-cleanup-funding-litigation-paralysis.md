# Superfund Cleanup Funding Litigation Paralysis

47,000+ identified hazardous sites vs 1,300 National Priorities List sites face systemic remediation failure from funding shortfall (billions needed annually vs actual appropriations), litigation quagmires (decades legal warfare over responsible parties), corporate bankruptcy evasion of liability, technical limitations of remediation technology (excavation $100-500/ton, stabilization temporary, phytoremediation decade-scale timescales), and climate amplification where flooding/wildfires spread contaminants beyond original sites overwhelming already-paralyzed cleanup capacity.
