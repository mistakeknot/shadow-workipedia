India 193 sand mining-related deaths 2019-2022 → criminal territory control + corruption of local officials + violence against journalists/activists + illegal night dredging → Morocco 45% sand illegally extracted → Mexico sand linked to cartel violence Veracruz → Kenya police protecting illegal mining → >60% criminal control threshold = state capacity collapse in sand regions, untouchable cartels (legal scarcity creates criminal opportunity, enforcement strengthens monopoly)
