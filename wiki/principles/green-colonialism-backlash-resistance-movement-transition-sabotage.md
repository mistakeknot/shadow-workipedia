# Green Colonialism Backlash Resistance Movement Transition Sabotage

Extraction-affected communities mobilize resistance movements opposing mining projects (Thacker Pass lithium mine Nevada facing indigenous legal challenges, Serbia lithium mine Rio Tinto abandoned after 100K protests 2022, Chilean lithium nationalization driven by indigenous water rights activism) where successful blockades delay or cancel 20-40% major extraction projects (2020-2025 precedent), and violent resistance escalates (Congo artisanal miner conflicts with industrial operators, Peru anti-mining protests killing 60+ 2020-2023) creating green transition sabotage as local opposition to extraction environmental/social costs generates political backlash threatening mineral supply security and potentially constraining transition speed through sustained resistance.
