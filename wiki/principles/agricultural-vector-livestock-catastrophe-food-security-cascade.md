# Agricultural Vector Livestock Catastrophe Food Security Cascade

Vector expansion threatens food security through livestock epidemics where Bluetongue killed 50,000 sheep/cattle (2006 Europe, €1.4B losses), African Swine Fever culled 7M+ pigs since 2018 ($10B+ damage), naive livestock populations lacking immunity experience 50-90% mortality forcing mass culling, trade restrictions cascade globally, endemic establishment creates permanent production losses as climate enables year-round transmission replacing historical seasonal breaks.
