# Earth Dependency Inescapable Timeline

Early colonies remain existentially dependent on Earth resupply for decades, with full self-sufficiency requiring minimum 50-100 years of industrial buildup and population growth to establish closed-loop manufacturing—measured by import dependency ratio (initial 95%+, target <20% for independence viability), critical spare parts lead time (6-24 months Earth-Mars), and minimum viable industrial population (estimated 10,000-100,000 for basic self-sufficiency).
