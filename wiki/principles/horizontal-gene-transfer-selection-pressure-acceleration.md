# Horizontal Gene Transfer Selection Pressure Acceleration

Bacterial resistance genes proliferate via plasmid conjugation (10^-5 to 10^-7 per cell division), transformation, transduction, and transposon jumping between species (E. coli→Klebsiella), amplified by sub-lethal antibiotic doses creating selection pressure that overcomes fitness costs (5-15% growth penalty) with compensatory mutations, driving MCR-1 colistin resistance global spread (China→70 countries in 18 months 2015-2017) and multi-drug resistant (MDR→XDR→PDR→TDR) progression where untreatable infections double every 5-7 years.
