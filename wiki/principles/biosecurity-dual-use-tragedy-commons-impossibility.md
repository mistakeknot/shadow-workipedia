# Biosecurity Dual Use Tragedy Commons Impossibility

AI biodesign models trained on pathogen data (viral genomes, protein sequences) enable beneficial research drug discovery, biofuel development, agricultural optimization but also lower barrier to bioterror where LLM suggests mutations for increased transmissibility (R₀ 3 → 10), reduced symptom severity extends infectious period, immune evasion evades existing vaccines with DIY lab execution $5,000 equipment, $500 oligonucleotide synthesis, 6-12 months development time creating dual-use dilemma where same tools cure and pandemic producing control options restrict model weights (keep biodesign AI classified academic/corporate only) but doesn't prevent leaks (happened with LLaMA, Stable Diffusion) slows global research concentrates power or biosecurity fine-tuning (train models to refuse pathogen queries) but easily circumvented jailbreaks, fine-tuning on private data or compute governance (require licensing for >10²³ FLOPs training runs biodesign model threshold) but high-resourced actors (nations, corporations) still access small actors blocked or open access (publish all models for maximum research benefit) but lowers barrier to bioterror accelerates DIY lab accidents chronic biosecurity threat and tragedy-of-commons where first nation/actor to deploy gene drive or release designer pathogen captures benefits (malaria eradication, bioweapon advantage, enhanced offspring competitive edge) while imposing costs on all (ecosystem collapse, pandemic, genetic inequality) creating race-to-bottom where cooperation required (international treaties, synthesis screening, germline editing bans) but defection incentivized producing enforcement impossibility where medical tourism, underground clinics, offshore facilities enable regulatory arbitrage making bans unenforceable without authoritarian surveillance biometric tracking, genetic monitoring which creates trust collapse publics fear both bioweapons and surveillance overreach.
