# Digital Exile Resistance Alternative Infrastructure Corporate State Convergence

Digital exiles build alternative infrastructure (cryptocurrency for payments, Tor for communication, decentralized platforms for social media) creating parallel digital society where 10M-50M users operate outside corporate ecosystem by 2030-2040, but state-corporate convergence counters through cryptocurrency regulation (requiring KYC, banning privacy coins), ISP-level censorship (blocking Tor exit nodes, DNS filtering), and financial chokepoint (banks refusing service to crypto exchanges) establishing impossible dilemma where resistance infrastructure either compromises principles (adopts KYC/surveillance) to achieve viability or maintains integrity while remaining marginal ensuring corporate-state digital control cannot be meaningfully challenged.
