# Retail Wipeout Wealth Transfer Institutional Accumulation

Retail investors buy tops (Google Trends correlation 0.85 with price peaks), sell bottoms (capitulation volume 3-5x normal) → wealth transfer retail → whales/institutions → each cycle concentrates holdings further (top 2% addresses hold 95% supply) → retail loss per cycle: 60-80% of late entrants lose money → behavioral pattern: FOMO entry → diamond hands copium → capitulation → sworn off → FOMO re-entry next cycle (recidivism 40-60%) → net wealth extraction from lower/middle class to early adopters and institutions.
