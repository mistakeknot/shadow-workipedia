# Cascading Tipping Point Interconnection Amplification

WAIS collapse 3-5m SLR over 200-300 years interacts with other climate tipping points creating amplification cascade where Greenland ice sheet (SW#57 AMOC collapse via freshwater input) destabilizes from WAIS-driven ocean circulation changes, Amazon dieback (SW#65) accelerates from altered precipitation patterns (Southern Ocean temperature gradients affect ITCZ), permafrost methane (SW#67) releases faster from Arctic warming amplification, and sea level rise triggers economic cascades where coastal infrastructure $10-30T stranded assets produce sovereign debt defaults (coastal nations lose tax base) triggering global financial crisis (bank exposure coastal real estate), migration waves 200-500M displaced overwhelm borders producing conflict escalation, and Antarctic militarization (treaty collapse resource rush) diverts adaptation funding ($5-15T resource competition vs $1-5T seawall investment) creating lose-lose where resource race prevents adaptation while adaptation delay enables resource competition and positive feedback where adaptation failure (insurance withdrawal, property value collapse -60-90%) reduces fiscal capacity future adaptation creating downward spiral where each decade's inaction makes subsequent adaptation costlier (+10-30% compound annual cost escalation) until crossing irreversibility threshold where adaptation costs exceed GDP capacity (~2060-2080 projected) producing permanent maladaptation equilibrium.
