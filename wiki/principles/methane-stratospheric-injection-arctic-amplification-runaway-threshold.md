# Methane Stratospheric Injection Arctic Amplification Runaway Threshold

East Siberian Arctic Shelf (2.1M km²) subsea permafrost degraded from -18°C to -1.5°C now releasing 17 Tg CH₄/year through 1,000+ observed plumes (up to 100 plumes/km² in hotspots), where catastrophic release of 5-50 Gt methane (subsea hydrate destabilization) would cause 0.5-2°C global temperature spike within 3-5 years, triggering runaway feedback when annual methane flux exceeds 100 Tg CH₄/year threshold making Arctic warming self-sustaining at 1°C/decade regardless of anthropogenic emissions.
