# Monarch Collapse Phenology Mismatch Climate Amplification

Monarch butterfly 90% decline (eastern) and 99.9% collapse (California 27M→2K) from milkweed habitat loss (90% Midwest tallgrass prairie destroyed), neonicotinoid nectar exposure killing caterpillars, and climate-induced phenology mismatches (flowering-emergence timing disrupted) previews specialist extinction pattern where migration-dependent species cannot adapt to rapid environmental change, while climate amplification (temperature extremes, precipitation disruption, range shift requirements exceed dispersal capacity) accelerates collapse beyond pesticide/habitat factors alone, making recovery impossible even if primary threats addressed.
