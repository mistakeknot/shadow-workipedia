# Grid Cascade Blackout Amplification

Single substation failure during AC demand surge 2-4× baseline (+10% per °C >35°C) propagates through grid when capacity margin <1.0, forcing blackout cascades 24-72 hours affecting 30-70% population, with blackout mortality spike multiplier ×3.0 when wet bulb >32°C + blackout >12 hours + nighttime >28°C prevents recovery, exemplified by Texas 2021 (2.5× surge, margin 0.85 → 246 deaths) and projected Phoenix 2050 (4.0× surge → 10-15k deaths), creating feedback loop where blackout damage ages grid infrastructure >30 years → equipment failures compound future cascade probability
