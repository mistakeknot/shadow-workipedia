# Temperature Thaw Active Layer Deepening Exponential Carbon Exposure

Warming penetrates soil layers at 2-5 cm/year in continuous permafrost zones, deepening active layer exponentially mobilizes carbon from frozen deposits—surface 0-3m contains 500 Gt carbon, where each +1°C warming increases decomposition rate 2-3× following Arrhenius equation (Q10 = 2.4), creating runaway feedback as thawed microbes resume decomposition releasing both CO₂ (aerobic zones) and methane (waterlogged anaerobic zones 25-85× more potent greenhouse effect).
