# Commercial Ancestry Backdoor

Consumer genomics companies (23andMe 15M, AncestryDNA 22M) collect DNA with minimal security—23andMe's 2023 breach exposed 6.9M users. This data enables re-identification of "anonymous" datasets, familial searches that identify relatives, and health status inference for insurance/employment discrimination.
