# Quantum Supremacy Race Geopolitical First Mover Cryptographic Hegemony

Quantum computing race creates winner-take-all scenario where first nation achieving CRQC (4,000+ logical qubits, <10^-3 error rate) gains 3-7 year cryptographic supremacy window before rivals catch up, enabling retroactive decryption of all adversary communications harvested 2020-2035 (estimated 50-500 exabytes NSA/China archives) and real-time SIGINT access to unupgraded systems (60-80% global infrastructure 2030-2035), establishing temporary cryptographic hegemony where intelligence advantage approaches perfect information during supremacy window.
