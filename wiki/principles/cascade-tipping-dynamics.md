# Cascade Tipping Dynamics

Multiple tipping points converge at +2.5-3.5°C (Amazon dieback 90 Gt CO₂, West Antarctic collapse, monsoon shifts) creating irreversible coupled collapse where each system weakens others' stabilization capacity, triggering 30-40% agricultural failure and forcing 500M+ forced migration within 60-year window.
