# Narco State Capture Irreversible

Once organized crime revenue exceeds 5-10% of GDP and cartel employment surpasses state security forces, institutional recapture becomes nearly impossible without external intervention or total state collapse—measured by cartel revenue as GDP percentage (Mexico ~3-5%, Honduras ~15-20%), cartel-employed personnel vs. police/military ratio, and state territory without effective government presence (Mexico ~30-40% by some estimates).
