# Three Strikes Mandatory Minimum Rigidity

Mandatory minimum sentencing (federal drug laws 1986/1988) and three-strikes laws (California 1994: 8,500 life sentences by 2012, 45% for nonviolent offenses) remove judicial discretion creating sentencing rigidity where average drug sentence 5-10 years regardless of circumstances → prisons operate at 200% capacity (California peak) → fiscal burden $50B/year state corrections + $7B/year federal (2023) diverts funding from education/healthcare → human cost 2.3M incarcerated peak (2008) + 68% recidivism → families destroyed + communities destabilized with no safety improvement (crime rates declined 50% 1990-2020 independent of incarceration levels).
