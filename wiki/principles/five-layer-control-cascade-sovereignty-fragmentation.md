# Five Layer Control Cascade Sovereignty Fragmentation

Corridors (physical) → Production (inputs) → Technology (transformation) → Distribution (access) → Price (economic) → disruption any layer cascades through all (transmission matrix: corridor→price 0.8 coefficient, 1-day delay) → bullwhip amplification 4× at supplier origin → import-dependent nations (Egypt 60% imports, 80% wheat from Russia) sovereignty collapse single-point-failure (control fragmented across layers, localized shocks become global crises)
