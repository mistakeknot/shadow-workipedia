# Infrastructure Asymmetry Attacker Advantage Kessler Inevitability

99% intercontinental data flows through 5,800+ satellites where attack costs $10-50M ASAT weapon destroying $500M asset in seconds creating 3,500+ debris pieces (2007 Chinese test precedent) while defense impossible (satellites fragile, predictable orbits, no evasion fuel), establishing 100:1 attacker advantage where debris density approaching critical threshold ~10,000 objects LEO (2024: ~9,000) ensures Kessler cascade self-sustaining collision exponential growth renders orbit unusable 50-100 years once triggered.
