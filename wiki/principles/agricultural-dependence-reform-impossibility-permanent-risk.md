# Agricultural Dependence Reform Impossibility Permanent Risk

Factory farms produce 70% global meat/eggs making abolition/reform politically impossible as food security collapse triggers immediate crisis, CAFO production projected +40% by 2050 increasing pandemic risk proportionally, post-pandemic reform windows close within 18-24 months (industry lobbying defeats regulation), business-as-usual scenario projects next zoonotic pandemic 2030s with no mitigation pathway, creating permanent existential threat from agricultural infrastructure.
