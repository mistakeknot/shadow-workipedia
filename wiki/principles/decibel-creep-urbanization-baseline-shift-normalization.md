# Decibel Creep Urbanization Baseline Shift Normalization

Average urban ambient noise 1950: 40-50 dB → 2020: 60-70 dB → continuous 20 dB increase = 100× perceived loudness → "quiet" now means <55 dB (pre-industrial: <30 dB) → baseline shift: each generation accepts louder normal → children never experience natural silence → WHO estimates 1.6M healthy life years lost annually in Europe alone → noise-induced hearing loss affects 12-15% of global population → acoustic trauma normalized as "city life."
