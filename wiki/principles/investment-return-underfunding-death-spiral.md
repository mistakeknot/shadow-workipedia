# Investment Return Underfunding Death Spiral

Gap between promised investment returns (7-8% actuarial assumptions enabling generous benefit formulas) and actual returns (2-3% in ZIRP/NIRP era) creates compounding underfunding where funded ratios collapse 80%→40%→25%, triggering desperate yield-chasing into riskier assets, losses requiring contribution increases that drive business flight, smaller tax base requiring higher per-capita costs, and accelerating insolvency spiral (Illinois $140B unfunded liability growing despite constitutional pension protection).
