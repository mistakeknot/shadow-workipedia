# Exodus Fiscal Collapse Ratchet

Sustained uninhabitability (wet bulb >33°C, mortality >100/100k/year, blackouts routine, no policy) triggers exodus beginning at >20% threshold, launching irreversible vicious cycle where population loss → real estate collapse -60-80% → stranded infrastructure ($100B+ abandoned) → tax base erosion → services collapse → accelerates exodus further, exemplified by Dust Bowl 1930s (2.5M exodus) and modern Rust Belt, with recovery impossible once exodus >30% (tax base too small, infrastructure too expensive per capita) requiring megacity abandonment
