# Quality Incident Detection Lag Trust Collapse

Valsartan 2018 NDMA carcinogen contamination → 4+ years before detection (accidental, routine testing upgrade) → 1,100+ product recalls globally → millions potentially exposed for years → Ranbaxy 2013 systematic data falsification (whistleblower, not inspection) → FDA inspects 2-3% foreign facilities annually → production locations often unknown → Heparin 2008 contamination 81 US deaths → bioequivalence failures 2-5% of tested generics (most never tested, subtherapeutic doses undiscovered)
