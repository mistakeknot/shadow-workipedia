# Habitat Fragmentation Monoculture Desert Flowering Resource Collapse

Agricultural intensification creates sterile monoculture deserts (edge-to-edge cultivation, hedgerow removal for efficiency, 40M acres US lawns herbicide-treated) eliminating insect habitat through landscape fragmentation (isolated patches insufficient for population connectivity), temporal discontinuity (flowering resource gaps between crop blooms), and nesting site destruction, while urban sprawl/development consume breeding grounds creating functional extinction where remaining fragments cannot sustain viable populations even if pesticides reduced.
