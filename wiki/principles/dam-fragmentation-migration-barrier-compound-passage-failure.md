# Dam Fragmentation Migration Barrier Compound Passage Failure

58,000+ large dams physically sever river ecosystems creating compounding migration barriers where passage failure rate exponentiates (0.05^n success through n dams, meaning 0.05^11 = 0.00000000002 survival for Mekong's 11 China dams), while 95%+ sediment trapping causes downstream delta sinking (15mm/year Mekong), saltwater intrusion (60km inland), fish ladder ineffectiveness (<5% real passage), destroying breeding cycles for 70% migratory species.
