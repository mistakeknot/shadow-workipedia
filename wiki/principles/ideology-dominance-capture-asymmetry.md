# Ideology Dominance Capture Asymmetry

Ideology accounts for 40% weight in legal regime adoption (highest), creating 18× difference where NP theocracy bias 0.90 vs Lib pluralism bias 0.05 drives regime transitions independent of cultural pressure, enabling rapid shift from Constitutional Pluralism (0.90 freedom score) → Theocratic Control (0.05) in autocracies under 2× faster transition multiplier while democracies constrain 0.50 flexibility, exemplified by Iran 1979 (NP ideology 0.90 + fundamentalism 0.90 + clerics 0.95 + autocracy flexibility 1.00 = 78% pro-theocracy forces) enabling revolutionary 3-step jump versus USA gradual 2010-2025 erosion (Lib → NC shift, freedom 0.85 → 0.70 due to democratic constraints)
