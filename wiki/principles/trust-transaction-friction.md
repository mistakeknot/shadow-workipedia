# Trust Transaction Friction

High institutional trust economies reduce transaction costs 30-50% through lower corruption (CPI >70) and efficient contract enforcement, while trust collapse below corruption threshold (CPI <40) increases friction 40-60% through informal institutions, barter, and hoarding, creating 1-2% permanent growth differential that compounds over decades into institutional poverty traps visible in post-Soviet economies (Ukraine <$5k GDP/cap) vs Scandinavia (>$80k GDP/cap)
