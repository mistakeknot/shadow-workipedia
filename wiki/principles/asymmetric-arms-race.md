# Asymmetric Arms Race

AI generation capabilities lead detection by 6-18 months with detection success rates declining from 80% (2014) to <20% (2030), creating structural attacker advantage as synthetic content generation costs fall exponentially ($1000 → $0.01 per piece) while deepfake quality rises asymptotically to 0.95+ perfection.
