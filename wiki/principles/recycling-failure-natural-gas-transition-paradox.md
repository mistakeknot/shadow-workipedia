# Recycling Failure Natural Gas Transition Paradox

Recycling rates <1% globally (most helium vented) → closed-loop MRI systems 10% of installed base → higher prices → natural gas producers invest in capture → BUT transition away from natural gas reduces co-production → net helium still declines → climate goals accelerated → helium co-production reduced → faster scarcity → climate action vs helium supply trade-off, no clean solution (energy transition inadvertently accelerates helium crisis)
