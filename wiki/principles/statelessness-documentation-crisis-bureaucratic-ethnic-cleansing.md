# Statelessness Documentation Crisis Bureaucratic Ethnic Cleansing

Document expiration cascade protracted displacement → 4.4M+ de jure stateless (230M unregistered children) → Rohingya 1982 denationalization 100% stateless → second-generation perpetual statelessness (children born stateless, multi-generational transmission) → return legally impossible without documentation → mass denaturalization = ethnic cleansing via paperwork (Myanmar, Bidoon, border shift cases, reversibility requires regime change)
