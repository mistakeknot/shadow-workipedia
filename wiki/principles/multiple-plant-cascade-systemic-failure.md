# Multiple Plant Cascade Systemic Failure

Single reactor meltdown (Fukushima Unit 1) triggers multi-unit cascade via shared infrastructure (Fukushima Units 2-3 same power supply, cooling systems, emergency response) → when external event affects multiple plants simultaneously (earthquake, hurricane, grid blackout, cyberattack) emergency response capacity saturated → US has 56 nuclear power plant sites with 93 reactors (1.7 reactors per site average), some sites 2-3 reactors → regional disaster (New Madrid earthquake, hurricane, coordinated attack) could affect 5-10 plants simultaneously → when meltdown probability 1-in-10,000 per reactor-year but 93 reactors operating = 1% annual US fleet probability → if 5-10 plants affected simultaneously (shared external event, emergency response inadequacy, spare parts exhaustion) cascading evacuations (5 plants × 160,000 people avg = 800,000 evacuated) and economic costs (5 plants × $200B = $1 trillion) exceed federal response capacity creating systemic collapse where individual plant safety measures adequate but correlated failure modes create fleet-wide catastrophic risk.
