# Security Vacuum Gang Governance Violence Monopoly State Failure

State security provision collapses in megacity periphery where police presence falls to 1 officer per 10,000-50,000 residents (vs 1 per 300-500 formal neighborhoods) enabling gang governance as criminal organizations fill vacuum providing security, dispute resolution, and public goods (schools, clinics, infrastructure funded by extortion) in exchange for taxation-through-violence, where gang-controlled territories reaching 30-60% megacity area (Rio favelas 22% city area 2020, Cape Town gang territories 40%+) establish violence monopoly as gangs out-gun police (automatic weapons, RPGs, drones vs pistols) creating state failure zones where government sovereignty nominal not actual.
