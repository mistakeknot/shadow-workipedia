# AI Triage Model Drift Bias Catastrophe

AI clinical systems adopted without validation → algorithmic triage denies care → model drift causes mass misdiagnosis → demographic bias encodes disparities → automation bias (humans defer to wrong AI) → black box opacity → liability vacuum (no one responsible when algorithms kill) (AI accuracy degrades post-deployment 2026+, bias amplifies health inequities, accountability impossible)
