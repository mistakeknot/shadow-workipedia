# Biosecurity Regime Collapse Governance Death Spiral

BWC effectiveness degrades when attribution <30% (verification impossible) + AI governance integration <30% (biosecurity and AI safety silos) + international coordination <30% (cooperative investigation fails) → treaty withdrawal cascades when major power perceives asymmetric constraint (cannot verify adversary compliance) → regime death when compliance confidence <20% → governance gap permanent because dual-use dilemma (same AI cures cancer AND creates bioweapons) makes regulation structurally impossible.
