# Agricultural Fungicide Cross Resistance Pipeline

80% of azole antifungals used in humans share molecular targets with agricultural fungicides sprayed on cereals, fruits, and ornamentals. Decades of environmental exposure have pre-adapted Aspergillus fumigatus populations; pan-azole resistance rose from <1% (1998) to 20%+ in European hotspots, leaving only echinocandins and amphotericin B.
