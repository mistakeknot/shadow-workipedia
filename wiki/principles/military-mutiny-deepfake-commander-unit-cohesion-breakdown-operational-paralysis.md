# Military Mutiny Deepfake Commander Unit Cohesion Breakdown Operational Paralysis

Deepfake video showing battalion commander calling soldiers to "stand with me against compromised civilian leadership" circulates via encrypted messaging (WhatsApp/Telegram) reaching 50-80% of unit within 6-12 hours, where 90-98% realism defeats visual recognition by soldiers who know commander personally, causing 20-40% to refuse orders (believe deepfake), 30-50% to delay compliance (uncertain), creating operational paralysis where unit cannot function with 50-70% non-compliance and 5-15% fragging risk (soldiers believing commander compromised may use force to "stop coup"), demonstrating how deepfakes weaponize epistemic crisis to destroy military cohesion.
