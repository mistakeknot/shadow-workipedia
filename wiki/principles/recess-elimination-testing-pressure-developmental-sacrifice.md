# Recess Elimination Testing Pressure Developmental Sacrifice

School recess declining 40% since 1990 → average recess 27 minutes (some schools 0) → No Child Left Behind/testing pressure → "every minute for instruction" → physical education cut 50% → play seen as waste → childhood scheduled wall-to-wall → developmental needs sacrificed for test scores.
