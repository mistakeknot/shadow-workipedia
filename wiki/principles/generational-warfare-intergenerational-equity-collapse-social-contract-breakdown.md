# Generational Warfare Intergenerational Equity Collapse Social Contract Breakdown

Demographic imbalance triggers intergenerational conflict as elderly 30-40% population (2050+ developed nations) vote for pension preservation while youth 15-20% face 50-70% effective tax rates (income tax + pension contributions + debt service for aging-driven deficits), where elderly political dominance (70%+ voter turnout vs 40% youth) ensures gerontocratic policy capture extracting $15-25T intergenerational wealth transfer (2020-2050 OECD) from working-age to retired through unfunded pension liabilities, creating social contract breakdown probability 40-60% as youth revolt against unsustainable redistribution either through emigration (brain drain) or political radicalization.
