# Codebase Fragmentation Productivity

Developer productivity decays maintaining multiple incompatible stacks (1 codebase = 100% baseline, 3 codebases = 50-70%, 5+ codebases = 30-50%) due to context switching, exponential testing overhead (3 regions = 9 test cases, 5 regions = 25 cases), and senior engineer diversion from innovation to compliance causing -30% to -60% velocity reduction.
