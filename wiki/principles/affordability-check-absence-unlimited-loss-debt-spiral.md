# Affordability Check Absence Unlimited Loss Debt Spiral

UK requires affordability checks (income-proportional limits) → US: no limits, only self-exclusion → average problem gambler debt $50,000-$90,000 → home equity, retirement, student loans accessed → payday loans for betting capital → sports betting apps integrate with banking → one-click deposits, friction-full withdrawals → "hot hand" mentality: chasing losses → 60% of problem gamblers contemplate suicide → bankruptcy, divorce, job loss → treatment availability: 100 beds nationally for gambling addiction.
