# Cost Explosion Abandonment Cycle

Veterinary costs have increased 10%+ annually (3x faster than inflation), with emergency vet visits now averaging $1,000-5,000 and cancer treatment $10,000-30,000—creating a threshold where middle-class families face bankruptcy-or-euthanasia decisions and lower-income owners increasingly abandon pets they can no longer afford to treat.
