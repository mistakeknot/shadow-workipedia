# Union Density Collapse Positive Feedback Spiral

Union density 35% (1954 peak) → 10% (2023) → private sector 6.1% approaching 6% neo-feudalism threshold creates compounding weakness → below 6% unions lack critical mass for political influence (donations, voter mobilization, lobbying) → labor law reforms impossible → collective bargaining coverage <3% → wage suppression accelerates → monopsony power (corporate consolidation HHI 1200 → 2400) funds union-busting budgets $50M-100M Walmart → consultant industry grows → organizing success drops → density falls further → FEEDBACK LOOP weaker unions → weaker NLRB enforcement → more effective union busting → lower density → BUT ALSO declining density → worker grievances accumulate (wage suppression 10-30%, insecurity, disrespect) → IF grievances >0.70 + catalyst event triggers SW#55 general strike which if victorious creates +30-40% union power surge BUT intensifies employer offensive +30-50% (consultant budgets surge, NLRB attacks accelerate, permanent replacement expands) creating unstable oscillation between suppression and explosion.
