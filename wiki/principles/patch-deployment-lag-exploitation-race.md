# Patch Deployment Lag Exploitation Race

Vulnerability disclosure → exploitation timeline compressed to 7-30 days average (2020) with zero-days exploited before patch available → patch deployment lag averages 60-120 days enterprise, 120-365 days government, 180+ days healthcare → legacy system persistence (Windows XP 10-20% hospitals, medical devices can't patch without FDA approval, SCADA systems can't restart) → attackers exploit lag window (EternalBlue patch available 2 months before WannaCry 300k infections, Log4j 87% downloads still vulnerable 6 months post-disclosure) → cybersecurity budget inadequacy (3-5% typical vs 15-20% needed = 3-4× underspend) perpetuates unpatched vulnerability accumulation where defensive measures lag attackers by 60-300 days creating guaranteed success window.
