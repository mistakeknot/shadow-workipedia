# Remediation Requires More Than Schools Can Provide

Recovering 2+ years of lost learning requires tutoring intensity schools cannot deliver. High-dosage tutoring (3+ hours/week, small groups) works but costs $2-4K/student/year. System built for 30:1 classrooms cannot suddenly provide 3:1 tutoring. Math doesn't add up.
