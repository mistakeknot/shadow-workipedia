# Geoengineering Termination Shock Lock In Governance Failure

Post-BOE albedo feedback +0.1-0.3°C global warming creates geoengineering pressure where Arctic refreezing technologies marine cloud brightening (spray seawater aerosols increase cloud albedo over Arctic Ocean) -0.5 to -1.5°C Arctic cooling $10B-$50B/year vs ice thickening (pump seawater onto ice surface winter freeze thicker ice) -0.3 to -0.8°C $5B-$20B/year vs stratospheric aerosols (SO₂ injection Arctic-only deployment) -1 to -2°C $20B-$100B/year creating cost-effectiveness trade-off where aerosols cheapest per °C but highest risk demonstrating termination shock where if geoengineering stopped abruptly (funding cuts, international opposition, technical failure) produces rapid warming +2-3°C over 5-10 years (worse than gradual warming same magnitude due to ecosystem/infrastructure adaptation lag) creating lock-in effect where once deployed at scale (>5 Tg SO₂/year aerosols threshold) termination shock risk means deployment must continue indefinitely or phase out over decades producing permanent commitment and moral hazard where geoengineering deployed → mitigation pressure drops (political economy "solved climate change" narrative reduces fossil fuel transition urgency) → emissions continue → eventually termination shock when geoengineering capacity exceeded or runaway warming when feedback dominates demonstrating coordination failure where no binding treaty geoengineering governance (Montreal Protocol ozone precedent exists but voluntary compliance) enables unilateral deployment risk where single nation acts (Russia Arctic refreezing national interest, China Polar Silk Road protection) triggering 60% sanctions probability from victim countries (downstream weather modification affects monsoons, precipitation patterns) plus compensation demands creating international conflict and unintended consequences where ozone depletion (stratospheric aerosols interfere with chemistry Montreal Protocol recovery), ecosystem toxicity (marine cloud brightening seawater aerosols salt deposition Arctic tundra vegetation), precipitation shifts (Arctic cooling affects ITCZ position, monsoon strength affecting 1B+ people) demonstrate irreversibility where ecological damage permanent even if geoengineering stopped producing lose-lose where deployment creates dependency (termination shock) and non-deployment accepts permanent ice loss (albedo feedback).
