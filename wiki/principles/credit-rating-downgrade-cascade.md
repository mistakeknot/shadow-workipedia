# Credit Rating Downgrade Cascade

Major disaster triggers 1-2 notch initial downgrade → borrowing cost spreads spike +100-300 basis points → fiscal stress intensifies from higher debt service → recurrent annual disasters drive 2-3 additional notches → junk status threshold (BB+ or lower) creates market access loss → borrowing costs explode (300 bps investment grade → 800-1500+ bps junk) making new borrowing impossible → foreign reserves depletion forces default or IMF program → contagion where rating agencies preemptively downgrade other climate-vulnerable nations → 20-50 vulnerable nations cascade to junk status (2025-2035) creating systemic sovereign debt crisis.
