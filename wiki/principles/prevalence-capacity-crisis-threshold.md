# Prevalence Capacity Crisis Threshold

Depression prevalence doubles 8%→18% post-2020 while psychiatric bed capacity collapses 550→11 beds/100k (98% reduction from 1950s), creating care rationing when beds <10/100k trigger ERs as de facto psychiatric wards with 24-72 hour boarding times and involuntary commitment thresholds rising to only imminent danger (rejecting chronic illness).
