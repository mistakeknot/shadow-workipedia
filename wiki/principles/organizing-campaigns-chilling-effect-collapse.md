# Organizing Campaigns Chilling Effect Collapse

Successful union busting creates deterrent cascade where organizing campaigns plummet 8,000 → 1,500 → 2,000 (Amazon/Starbucks surge) as fear deters organizing attempts → campaign survival to election 48% → 70% win rates when elections occur BUT campaigns increasingly don't launch (pre-campaign consultant intervention suppresses organizing interest 30-60%, vulnerability assessments target potential leaders, illegal firings 20% of organizers in campaigns create chilling effect 1 firing deters 10-20 others) → paradox of popular but weak unions (71% public approval 2023 highest since 1965 vs 10% density lowest ever) where workers want unions but fear retaliation (job loss, blacklisting, immigration enforcement, violence 0.01-5% monthly if desperation) → when union institutional memory lost (organizers retire, locals dissolve, know-how disappears) rebuilding takes 20-30 years even with favorable policy creating generational suppression where successful union busting in one era prevents organizing attempts in the next creating permanent two-tier labor market (unionized legacy workers vs non-union majority).
