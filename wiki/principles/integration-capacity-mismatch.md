# Integration Capacity Mismatch

Arrival rates exceeding resettlement capacity by 3-10× ratio create permanent camps lasting decades where second-generation refugees born into statelessness never see homeland, while high integration ($5k-$15k/refugee/year) produces positive economic contribution after 5-10 years but requires 2-5% GDP fiscal burden unsustainable at scale
