# Austerity Political Sustainability Impossibility Democracy Incompatibility

Debt repayment through austerity proves politically unsustainable as required fiscal adjustment 5-15% GDP (Greece 2010-2015 precedent) triggers unemployment 15-25%, GDP contraction 20-30%, and social unrest probability 60-80%, where democratic governments cannot implement austerity severity required for debt sustainability (IMF projections require 20+ years discipline) as electoral cycles 2-4 years ensure voter backlash replacing austerity governments with populist alternatives promising default, creating democracy-debt-repayment impossibility triangle where only authoritarian states can sustain austerity making default political inevitability for democracies.
