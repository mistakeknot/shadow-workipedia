# Pension Collapse Multi Decade Inevitability Denial

Unlike financial crises exploding suddenly, pension collapses unfold over decades through mathematical inevitability (birth rates + life expectancy + investment returns = deterministic projection) creating "slow-motion train wreck" where each generation passes larger unfunded liabilities to next, politicians promise unpayable benefits to win elections, accounting gimmicks disguise true costs, and reform blockage continues until system hits cash flow negative requiring immediate 30-50% benefit cuts, retirement age raises to 75+, means testing, and abandonment of pay-as-you-go for individual accounts after permanent trust breakdown.
