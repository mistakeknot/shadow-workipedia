# Extraction Subsidence Irreversibility Megacity Collapse

Jakarta 25cm/year (world's fastest sinking city) + 4m total since 1970 + 40% below sea level → Mexico City 10m since 1900 (ancient lake bed) + 40% water lost to cracked pipes → Bangkok controlled at 1-2cm/year after intervention (10cm/year 1980s peak) → clay compaction past preconsolidation stress = permanent structure destruction → recharging aquifer does nothing → land is gone (geologic timescales 10,000+ years for reformation, irreversibility is absolute)
