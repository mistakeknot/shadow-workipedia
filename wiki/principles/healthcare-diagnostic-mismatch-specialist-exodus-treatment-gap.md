# Healthcare Diagnostic Mismatch Specialist Exodus Treatment Gap

Temperate healthcare systems structurally unprepared for tropical disease burden where 70% physicians lack tropical medicine training, diagnostic delays average 3-6 months (180 days Lyme diagnosis), treatment costs explode $500→$50,000+ per case (chronic Lyme $50K-$100K), specialist wait times exceed 120 days, antimalarial/antifungal stockpiles absent, workforce exodus from newly endemic regions creates permanent diagnostic blindness.
