# Liability Evasion Shell Game Bankruptcy Orphaning

3.7M abandoned US wells ($280-500B cleanup liability) → corporate structure exploitation (create subsidiary, transfer marginal wells, bankrupt subsidiary, parent keeps profits) → PE accelerated pattern 2015+ (Alta Mesa 2019, 2,000+ wells orphaned) → bonding inadequacy (TX $50k statewide vs. $75k-3M/well actual cost) → regulatory capture (industry writes rules, revolving door personnel) → 800k-1.2M orphaned wells no viable owner (privatized profits, socialized cleanup costs, completely legal)
