# Care Demand Exponential Aging Disability Childcare Convergence

Care demand accelerates exponentially as elderly 65+ reach 1.5B (2040) from 700M (2020) requiring assistance with ADLs (activities of daily living) 40% rate, disabled population grows to 1.5B (15% global) from 1B (2020), and childcare needs persist for 2B children under-5 despite demographic decline, where total care requirement reaches 400M full-time equivalent caregivers (2040) vs available workforce 200M creating 200M caregiver deficit ensuring widespread unmet need affecting 500M-1B people lacking adequate care.
