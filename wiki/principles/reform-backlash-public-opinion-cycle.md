# Reform Backlash Public Opinion Cycle

Decarceration reforms (First Step Act 2018 federal 3,000 early releases, California AB 109 Realignment 2011 -20% prison population 2011-2020, bail elimination New York 2020/Illinois 2023) + reformist prosecutor elections (Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles 2016-2020) trigger "tough-on-crime" political backlash via "crime wave" narratives (retail theft videos, Fox News coverage) → public opinion shifts from 65% reform support (2015-2018) → 45% (2023-2024) → prosecutor recalls (SF Chesa Boudin 60% voted yes 2022) → new mandatory minimums proposed (fentanyl, retail theft) → reform momentum stalls despite crime perception-reality gap (perception increases while actual crime declining).
