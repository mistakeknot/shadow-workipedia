# Dependency Ratio Growth Collapse

Working-age population (15-64) to dependent ratio shift from 1:1 (6 TFR youth societies) to 1:0.5 (1.5 TFR aging societies) creates fiscal drag where healthcare + pension spending rises from 4-6% to 14-18% of GDP, shrinking growth-driving investment by 3-5 percentage points, exemplified by Italy (58% of population >45, pension spending 16% of GDP, growth averaging 0.5% last 15 years) versus India (median age 27, 60% working-age, projected 6-7% growth runway)
