# Petro State Hyperinflation Collapse

Oil revenue >60-90% budget dependency (Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria) with break-even prices $80-100/barrel creates fiscal death spiral when sustained prices <$40 for 2+ years, triggering wealth fund depletion → currency collapse → hyperinflation 1M%+ (Venezuela 2014-2020 calibration) → migration exodus 5M+ → regime change risk 40-60%, while diversification attempts require decades but collapse happens in months
