# Voluntary Buyout Failure Constitutional Stalemate

Managed retreat programs offering 50-100% pre-crisis property value achieve only 10-30% voluntary participation (loss aversion, attachment, sunk cost fallacy) → mandatory buyout programs via eminent domain trigger 5th Amendment "Takings Clause" litigation ($10M-$500M legal costs, 5-15 year timelines) → Supreme Court constitutional crisis (precedent: regulatory vs physical takings) → militia "hold the line" armed resistance (Bundy Ranch 2014 precedent) → federal troops vs civilians → casualties → policy paralysis while population remains trapped in uninhabitable zones.
