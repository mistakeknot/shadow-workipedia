# Gun Suicide Lethal Means Male Crisis

56% of gun deaths are suicide (27,023 of 48,204 in 2022) → firearms 85% completion rate vs overdose 5% → firearm access 3-5× risk multiplier → male concentration (7× rate) + veteran overrepresentation → waiting periods reduce suicide 7-11% → safe storage laws effective → but means restriction politically impossible (most preventable gun deaths from suicide, lethality not intent, impulsivity + access = death, prevention known but blocked)
