Tier 0 supplements $10-50K/year (metformin, rapamycin, NAD+) 5-10 year gains → Tier 1 senolytics $50-200K → Tier 2 gene therapy lite $200K-1M → Tier 3 full age reversal $2-10M 30+ years → Tier 4 biological immortality $10M+ 100+ years → 2045 median lifespan: top 0.1% 120 years, bottom 50% 68 years → 2071: rich 175 years, middle 85, poor 62 (each tier exponentially more expensive, lifespan becomes ultimate class marker)
