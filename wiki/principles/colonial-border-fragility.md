# Colonial Border Fragility

Arbitrary 1884 Berlin Conference boundaries split ethnic groups and unite rivals, creating 54 states with ~3,000 ethnic groups where virtually every border cuts through indigenous nations, ensuring permanent identity-state mismatch that erupts when central authority weakens—measured by ethnic fractionalization index (0.65+ average) and cross-border ethnic kin networks (87% of African ethnic groups span multiple states).
