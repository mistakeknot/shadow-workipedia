# Subsidence Amplification Sand Protection Feedback

Sand mining lowers riverbeds → groundwater drops → subsidence accelerates (SW#124 connection) → coastal infrastructure fails → more sand needed for coastal protection → extraction increases → subsidence accelerates further → protection more expensive → vicious cycle (extraction for protection accelerates need for protection, no equilibrium)
