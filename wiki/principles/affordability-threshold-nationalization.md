# Affordability Threshold Nationalization

Water cost as household income percentage triggers political crisis when crossing thresholds (1-3% manageable → 3-5% stress → >5% crisis with nationalization support 0.60-0.80), driven by desal premium ($2,000-$5,000/acre-foot vs surface water $500-$1,500) compounded by crisis surcharges (+20% to +50%) and contract escalators (CPI+1-2%), but nationalization deterred by BIT arbitration costs ($1B-$10B, Argentina precedent: 60-80% investor recovery probability).
