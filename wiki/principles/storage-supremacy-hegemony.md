# Storage Supremacy Hegemony

Upstream storage capacity exceeding 1.5x annual flow creates irreversible hydrological hegemony (China Mekong 55.3 BCM exceeds downstream allocation, Ethiopia GERD 74 BCM = 1.3x Egypt total, Turkey GAP 140 BCM = 3x downstream flow), enabling flow weaponization once dam construction passes 70% completion unstoppability threshold.
