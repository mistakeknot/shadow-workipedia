# Fire Intensity Convection Threshold Stratospheric Injection Amplification

Megafires exceeding 100,000 kW/m fire intensity (achievable via 15+ simultaneous ignition points across 2,000 km fireline during 35°C temperatures, 15% humidity, 18 m/s wind conditions) generate pyrocumulonimbus clouds with 85% probability, where convection column reaches 12-14 km altitude injecting 150 kt smoke into stratosphere creating 60-70% solar blocking over 800,000 km² agricultural regions downwind, causing -45% photosynthesis during critical grain fill reducing yields -35% and triggering $12B agricultural losses.
