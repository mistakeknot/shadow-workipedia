# COVID Politicization Partisan Polarization Unprecedented Gap

COVID vaccines → partisan gap 32 percentage points (92% Democrat vs 60% Republican completion) → largest for any vaccine in US history → mandate resistance (17M+ healthcare workers) → booster fatigue (70% primary, 15% updated booster) → trust erosion from changing guidance + breakthrough infections (pandemic transformed hesitancy from fringe to mainstream political identity, vaccination status = tribal marker, science became partisan)
