# Orphan Generation Depletion Cascade Bankruptcy Surge

Well production drops <$15-25/barrel profitability → "temporarily abandoned" status → 40-60% convert to permanent orphans → 2015-2023 oil price volatility 50+ bankruptcies → bankruptcy court extinguishes liability → state takes responsibility without funding → orphan rate exceeds plugging rate (15-20k/year capacity vs. accumulating backlog, 50-80yr timeline current rate, depletion accelerates marginal well abandonment)
