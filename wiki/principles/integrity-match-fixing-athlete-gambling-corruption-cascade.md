# Integrity Match Fixing Athlete Gambling Corruption Cascade

Legal betting creates fixing markets → prop bets most vulnerable (individual stats controllable) → college athletes unpaid, vulnerable to bribes → 1919 Black Sox, 2007 NBA ref Tim Donaghy, 2023 Alabama baseball → in-game betting increases fixing opportunities (single play manipulation) → international syndicates access US markets → sports leagues paradox: profit from data sales to bookmakers, harmed by integrity threats → monitoring systems lag fixing sophistication → scandal discovery = existential threat to leagues.
