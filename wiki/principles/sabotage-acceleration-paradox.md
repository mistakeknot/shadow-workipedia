# Sabotage Acceleration Paradox

Pipeline/refinery attacks (Keystone XL precedent) create supply disruption → price spike short-term but accelerate renewable adoption long-term, while insurance premiums increase +20-50% post-incident making marginal projects uneconomic, creating self-defeating dynamic where fossil industry security costs compound decline but activist victories worsen worker displacement triggering counter-backlash
