# Pharmaceutical Rd Market Failure Innovation Drought

Antibiotic development economics catastrophe (development cost $1.5B vs average revenue $46M/year = -97% ROI, last new class discovered 1987 lipopeptides) drives 18 of 20 major pharmaceutical companies to abandon antibiotics (1990-2020) leaving only small biotechs with limited resources, creating pipeline collapse (43 antibiotics vs 1,300+ cancer drugs) insufficient to replace drugs where resistance emerges 2-3 years post-introduction vs 10-15 year development timeline, while push/pull incentives (CARB-X $500M, market entry rewards $1-2B) prove insufficient to change economics.
