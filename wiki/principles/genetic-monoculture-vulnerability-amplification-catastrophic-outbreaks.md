# Genetic Monoculture Vulnerability Amplification Catastrophic Outbreaks

Industrial consolidation creates genetically identical populations (Cornish Cross chicken, Yorkshire pig) where single pathogen exposure triggers total population susceptibility, H5N1 HPAI outbreak (2020-2024) culled 500M+ poultry globally, African Swine Fever eliminated 50% China pig herd (200-400M animals, >$100B damage 2018-2020), making monoculture vulnerability impossible to contain as entire CAFOs require simultaneous depopulation.
