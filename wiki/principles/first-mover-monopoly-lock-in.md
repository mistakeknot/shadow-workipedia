# First Mover Monopoly Lock In

Whoever reaches high-value asteroids first establishes de facto property rights regardless of legal framework, with first-mover advantages compounding over time as early revenues fund further expansion—measured by claim density concentration (top 3 actors controlling projected 60-90% of economically viable asteroids), infrastructure lock-in index, and revenue reinvestment rate (enabling exponential capability growth).
