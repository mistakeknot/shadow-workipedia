# Carbon Flip Paris Agreement Impossibility Cascade

Amazon carbon sink historical 2 GtCO₂/year absorption (1970-2010) represents 15-25% global terrestrial carbon uptake where dieback transformation to source 1-5 GtCO₂/year emissions creates 3-7 GtCO₂/year swing (sink loss + source emission) equivalent to 7-15% current global emissions rendering Paris Agreement 1.5°C target impossible (requires emissions peak 2025, net zero 2050, Amazon flip adds 3-7 GtCO₂/year forcing either faster fossil fuel cuts politically unachievable or accepting 2-2.5°C warming triggering other tipping points AMOC collapse SW#63, WAIS collapse SW#64, permafrost pulse SW#67) and positive feedback where Amazon dieback → global temperature +0.1-0.3°C → accelerates other tipping points → further warming → more Amazon drying creating interconnected tipping cascade where preventing any single tipping point (Amazon, AMOC, WAIS, permafrost, Arctic) requires preventing all creating collective action problem where Amazon protection benefits global climate (public good) but costs Brazil sovereignty/economic growth (private cost) producing tragedy of commons where Brazil rational incentive defect (maximize deforestation) despite global catastrophe creating enforcement impossibility where debt-for-nature swaps $100B+ forgiveness expensive + sovereignty crisis, sanctions risk Brazil-China pivot, supply chain boycotts ineffective (substitution beef → poultry, soy → other oils) leaving no viable intervention preventing dieback.
