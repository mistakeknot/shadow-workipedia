# Property Rights Equity Displacement Asymmetry

Mandatory retreat compensation frameworks create stratification where wealthy homeowners negotiate higher payouts (100% pre-crisis value + legal representation) while renters receive zero compensation (no property ownership), low-income homeowners get 50-70% value (less negotiating power, forced sales), and municipalities face inverse condemnation lawsuits ($100M-$1B) when infrastructure abandonment (roads, water, power) renders remaining properties uninhabitable, creating environmental justice crisis where poorest populations bear displacement costs while wealthiest extract maximum public compensation.
