# Felon Disenfranchisement Mass Incarceration Racial Disparity

4M disenfranchised (1.7% voting age) → Black 4.5% disenfranchisement vs white 1.5% (3× disparity) → 70% living in community (not incarcerated) → permanent exclusion after sentence → state variation (FL lifetime ban vs ME/VT no restriction) → integration with SW#9 mass incarceration (criminal justice system used as voter suppression tool, racial targeting via incarceration, punishment continues post-release, democratic participation stratified by race)
