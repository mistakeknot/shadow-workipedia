# Food Price Shocks Regime Destabilization Bread Riots

Food share income >35% = regime risk threshold → +50% price spike = riot probability trigger → subsidy fiscal capacity exhaustion → Arab Spring 2010-11 precursor +40% food index → security force escalation → regime collapse cascade → refugee flows (documented: Sri Lanka 2022 fertilizer ban → +90% food inflation → government fell 6 months, price transmission faster than mitigation)
