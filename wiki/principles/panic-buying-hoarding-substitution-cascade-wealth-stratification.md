# Panic Buying Hoarding Substitution Cascade Wealth Stratification

Shortage visibility triggers irreversible panic dynamics where social media spreads faster than restocking (images of empty shelves viral within hours), rational hoarding depletes 3-day buffers same day, substitution cascades (can't find chicken→pork→beef→beans) exhaust entire categories, wealth advantage allows rich to stockpile $1000s while poor face empty shelves creating artificial scarcity that becomes real scarcity through feedback loops.
