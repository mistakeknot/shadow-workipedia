# Refugee Capacity Saturation

Resettlement capacity degrades nonlinearly when refugee inflow exceeds 2-3% annual population growth (>2% inflow → 60-80% capacity saturation within 5 years) because integration systems scale linearly while social friction scales quadratically, creating domestic backlash (+10-30% far-right vote) even when policy supports open acceptance.
