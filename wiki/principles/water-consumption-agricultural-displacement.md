# Water Consumption Agricultural Displacement

Data center cooling requirements (1 facility = 10,000-50,000 homes equivalent, 3.8M liters/year per MW) exceeding 10% basin allocation triggers water rights transfer from agriculture to tech companies (70% win probability via political influence), causing 30-50% farm bankruptcy increases in affected counties and -0.25 legitimacy penalty as environmental justice frames diversion as colonial resource extraction.
