# Moderate Radical Split Compromise Trap

Strike coalitions inherently unstable as moderates (union officials, reformist parties) accept compromise while radicals (revolutionary activists, militant workers) demand total victory → France 1968 CGT union leaders accepted Grenelle Accords (+25% minimum wage, workplace committees) but students/radicals rejected and occupied Sorbonne for weeks → UK 1926 TUC (Trades Union Congress) capitulated day 9 abandoning miners who continued alone for months → state exploits split by offering partial concessions satisfying moderates (isolates radicals who then crushed) vs refusing all demands radicalizes moderates into revolutionary coalition → optimal state strategy: negotiate with moderates while repressing radicals, optimal striker strategy: prevent split via democratic decision-making but this slows response enabling state countermeasures → when moderate-radical split occurs 70% probability strike collapses within 48 hours (moderates return, radicals isolated and arrested) vs unified coalitions endure 2-4 weeks but demand maximalism prevents compromise creating paradox where unity enables endurance but prevents negotiated victory.
