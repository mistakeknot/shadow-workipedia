# Yedoma Ice Content Catastrophic Volume Loss Carbon Pulse

Yedoma permafrost (500,000 km² across Siberia/Alaska) contains 50% organic carbon by weight (vs 2-5% typical soils) and 50-90% ice by volume, creating catastrophic collapse mechanics where ice wedge melting triggers 10-30 m/year headwall retreat (Batagaika megaslump), exposing 50,000-90,000 year old organic deposits to decomposition 3-10× faster than gradual thaw, threatening release of 500-1,000 Gt carbon (30-60% of all permafrost carbon in 3% of area) if >20% thaws.
