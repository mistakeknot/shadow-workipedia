# Escalation Ladder Ignition Seeding Shootdown Conventional War Nuclear Threshold

PyroCb warfare escalates through rungs (Rung 3: covert ignition, Rung 5: rain bomb seeding, Rung 8: aircraft shootdown attempting seeding, Rung 12: conventional retaliation strikes against fire-starting bases) where each rung increases casualties 10-100× and crosses successively harder-to-reverse thresholds, culminating in Rung 20+ nuclear crisis when smoke warfare blocks solar radiation over nuclear-armed adversary's territory triggering 1-5% accidental launch probability within 30 days as early warning systems degrade and launch authority becomes ambiguous under catastrophic agricultural collapse.
