# Infrastructure Cascade Magnification

Single-sector attack triggers cascade via dependencies (power grid failure → water pumps stop → sewage backs up → communications depletes batteries 6 hours → food refrigeration fails → hospitals on generators 3-7 day fuel → mass evacuation) → cascade timing T+6h batteries, T+12h water/sewage, T+24h food spoilage, T+3d distribution halt, T+7d generator exhaustion patient deaths, T+14d complete societal collapse → damage magnification 5-10× for 2-sector cascade, 20-100× for 3+ sectors (Colonial Pipeline $5B single-sector vs Ukraine grid potential $50B+ multi-sector) → restoration complexity power 6-168 hours, transformers 12-24 months if damaged → seasonal vulnerability modifiers (winter heating ×3 hypothermia deaths, summer cooling ×2 heat stroke) where single attack cascades exponentially across interconnected systems.
