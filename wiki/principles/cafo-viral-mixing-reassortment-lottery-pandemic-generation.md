# CAFO Viral Mixing Reassortment Lottery Pandemic Generation

Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations pack tens of thousands genetically identical animals creating viral pressure cookers where single pig hosts human/avian/swine influenza simultaneously (40% coinfection at >1000 animals/hectare), 8-segment influenza genome generates 2^8=256 reassortant combinations per coinfection, 10^14 mutation experiments per day per facility, 2009 H1N1 pandemic emerged from North Carolina pig CAFOs (triple-reassortant infecting 1.4B people), making each CAFO a lottery machine spinning for pandemic-capable virus.
