# Code Is Law Exploit Is Feature Legal Vacuum

Smart contracts execute exactly as written regardless of intent → exploits are "valid" transactions (not hacks in traditional sense) → $3.8B stolen in 2022 alone via "legitimate" contract interactions → legal recourse near-zero (no jurisdiction, pseudonymous attackers, "you agreed to the code") → victim recovery rate <5% → creates moral hazard where security audits are optional (cost $50-500K) while exploit insurance is rare → structural vulnerability: complexity grows faster than security tooling.
