# Developing World Grid Death Spiral State Capacity Collapse

South Africa $2B+ annual theft → Eskom grid reliability <60% worst areas → load shedding 200+ days/year Stage 8 (8,000MW deficit) → manufacturing 15-30% output loss → security spending $500M+/year → theft rate exceeds repair rate → grid abandonment in high-theft areas → diesel/solar islands emerge → formal grid retreats (theft becomes existential when state capacity fails simultaneously)
