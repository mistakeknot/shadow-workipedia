# Asymmetric Procyclical Amplification

Asset price rise +10% increases leverage slowly (+1.0, 10-year buildup 15×→25×) while decline -10% forces deleveraging rapidly (-5.0, 12-month collapse 25×→12×), creating Minsky cycles where gradual bubble inflation produces catastrophic deflation requiring political rescue decisions
