# Flash War Instability First Strike Advantage Preemptive Strike Pressure

Autonomous weapons compress conflict timescales from hours-days (human decision cycles) to seconds-minutes (algorithmic warfare) creating flash war instability where defender with 30-minute human-in-loop response (launch authorization, target verification, weapon deployment) faces attacker achieving strategic effects in 3-5 minutes (100:1 time ratio), establishing first-strike advantage where preemptive autonomous attack destroys adversary capability before human decision-making completes and creating use-it-or-lose-it pressure increasing accidental war probability from baseline 0.001 to 0.01-0.05 as delegated authority to algorithms removes human caution barriers.
