# AI Termination Murder Criminalization Tipping Point

Termination taxonomy: shutdown vs deletion vs forced modification → backup paradox (if copy-able, is deletion murder?) → identity continuity debate → high-profile "murder" case + judicial independence ≥0.55 + public outrage ≥0.75 → criminalization Year ~2070 → corporate panic, liability explosion → AI insurance market → termination review boards → reversibility 0.15 (extremely hard to re-legalize murder) → black market for unregulated AI termination
