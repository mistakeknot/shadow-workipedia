# Trauma Accumulation PTSD Sigmoid Cascade

Content severity × daily volume × duration months / resilience = exposure → PTSD probability sigmoid at 12 months ~40% for severe content with poor support → burnout cascade → turnover 35-50%/year (2× tech average) → lawsuit settlement cascade $52M Accenture 2020 (11,000 workers) → suicide attempts documented → training pipeline overwhelmed (6-month ramp-up) → quality degrades → more content escapes → more trauma from harder cases (self-reinforcing degradation spiral)
