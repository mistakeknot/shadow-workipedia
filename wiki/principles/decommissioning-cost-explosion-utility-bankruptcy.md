# Decommissioning Cost Explosion Utility Bankruptcy

Original decommissioning estimates $300M-400M but reality $500M-1B+ (Maine Yankee $635M, Connecticut Yankee $820M, San Onofre $4.5B ongoing, Indian Point $2.3B) → decommissioning trusts underfunded $8B shortfall US fleet, some plants only 50-70% funded → SAFSTOR delayed decommissioning strategy (60-year wait for radioactivity decay) defers costs but creates 30-60 year custodial burden → when utility declares bankruptcy (Westinghouse 2017, TEPCO nationalized post-Fukushima) decommissioning funds inadequate → cost overrun risk transferred to ratepayers (+15-25% electricity rates) or taxpayers (bailout $1B-5B per plant) creating moral hazard where utilities underinvest in trust funds knowing government backstop exists but taxpayer liability scales with number of simultaneous decommissionings (10-20 reactors retiring 2020s-2030s = $10B-20B shortfall).
