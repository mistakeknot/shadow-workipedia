# Critical Chokepoint Cascade Multiplier Economics

Global supply chain consolidation creates critical chokepoints where <5 facilities control >80% production (TSMC 90% advanced chips 3nm/5nm, China 80% rare earth processing, India 60% pharmaceutical precursors) with just-in-time fragility (automotive 2-3 day inventory) and substitute scarcity (no alternative suppliers advanced nodes/specialized chemicals) producing cascade multipliers where 1 day fab shutdown = 10 days downstream disruption via chip shortage → car production → dealer inventory → consumer prices and single-plant kill switch attacks ($5M-20M ransom Colonial Pipeline/JBS Foods) cascade to $10B-100B losses (2021-2023 chip shortage 10M vehicles $210B, 2011 Thailand floods hard drive 75% production +30% PC prices, 2021 Suez 6 days $10B/day) creating strategic leverage where nation-states weaponize chokepoint control (rare earth export bans, fab nationalization threats) and attack planning identifies critical nodes (semiconductor → automotive → construction, pharmaceutical precursors → generics → chronic disease treatment) for maximum economic warfare impact without kinetic conflict.
