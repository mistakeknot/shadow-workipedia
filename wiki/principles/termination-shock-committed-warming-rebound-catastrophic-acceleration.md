# Termination Shock Committed Warming Rebound Catastrophic Acceleration

Stopping SAI after 10-20 years deployment reveals 1-2°C committed warming within 3-5 years (vs century-scale natural warming) as aerosol masking removed instantaneously while CO₂ remains elevated, creating extinction-level temperature spike where ecosystems adapted to cooled baseline experience 0.3-0.5°C/year warming (10-20× natural rate) driving mass extinction 40-60% species unable to migrate fast enough, while agricultural zones shift 500-1000 km poleward within 3-5 year window impossible for farming adaptation triggering 500M-2B famine deaths.
