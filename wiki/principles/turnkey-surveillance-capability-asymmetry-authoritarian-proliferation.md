# Turnkey Surveillance Capability Asymmetry Authoritarian Proliferation

Commercial spyware turnkey deployment enables low-capability regimes deploy advanced surveillance $150M investment national-scale system (vs $5B+ domestic development), 6-12 month deployment (vs 5-10 years indigenous capabilities), zero technical expertise required (vendor operates systems remotely) creating capability asymmetry where Pegasus (NSO Group) 50,000+ targets 45 countries, Candiru Windows zero-days authoritarian regimes UK journalists, Cytrox mobile exploits Greek opposition Egyptian dissidents, FinFisher deep packet inspection Bahrain/Ethiopia protest surveillance enables repression previously impossible (journalists, activists, opposition leaders) with cost per target $50K-$500K (implant development + infrastructure + operations) economically viable for authoritarian regimes targeting 100-10,000 individuals compared to mass surveillance $10B-$100B costs (NSA/China precedent) creating selective repression dynamics where targeted surveillance deadlier than broadcast (identification → arrest → torture → disappearance chain vs passive monitoring) and diaspora reach where spyware deployed against exiled dissidents (Saudi dissidents in Canada/UK/US via Pegasus, Uyghur diaspora Europe via Chinese vendors) violates sovereignty (no extradition required, cyber operations cross borders freely) creating jurisdictional immunity paradox where democratic states host surveillance victims but lack legal framework prosecute foreign cyber operations against residents unless vendor assets exposed creating enforcement asymmetry.
