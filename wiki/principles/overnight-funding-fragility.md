# Overnight Funding Fragility

Repo overnight funding >80% of dealer balance sheets creates 4-day collapse window (Bear Stearns $17B run March 10-14, Lehman $2T freeze) when haircuts escalate Treasury 2%→10% / MBS 5%→50% / Corporate 8%→refused, forcing impossible bailout timing decisions before contagion assessment complete
