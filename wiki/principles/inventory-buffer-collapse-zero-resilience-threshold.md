# Inventory Buffer Collapse Zero Resilience Threshold

Fifty years optimization eliminates resilience by stripping inventory from 90-day buffers (1970s) to 3-day grocery cycles, 1-2 week hospital supplies, 4-8 hour manufacturing parts inventories, creating catastrophic fragility where any disruption triggers immediate shortages as grocery stores deplete in 3 days, hospitals ration by week 2-3, manufacturers halt in hours, crossing 72-hour visibility cliff where empty shelf images trigger irreversible panic buying cascades faster than restocking possible.
