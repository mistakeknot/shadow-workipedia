# Global Atmospheric Forcing Dominance

A VEI 7-8 eruption injects 100-1,000 km³ of ash and sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere—the resulting aerosol layer blocks 10-20% of sunlight for 2-5 years, dropping global temperatures 5-15°C, destroying multiple growing seasons worldwide regardless of eruption location.
