# Care System Failure Provider Shortage Treatment Gap

Mental health provider ratio insufficient → 122M/37% population in shortage areas → average waitlist 3+ months (6+ typical) → treatment gap 40-60% with illness don't receive care → insurance barriers + stigma deterrence → burnout cascade (providers overwhelmed, quit, worsens shortage) (deliberate underfunding creates permanent crisis, care when needed impossible, most suffering untreated, system structurally inadequate)
