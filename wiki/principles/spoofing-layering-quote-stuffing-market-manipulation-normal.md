# Spoofing Layering Quote Stuffing Market Manipulation Normal

Navinder Sarao (Flash Crash contributor) used $40 software to move trillion-dollar markets → spoofing: fake orders to move prices, cancel before execution → layering: multiple spoof levels creating false depth → quote stuffing: millions of orders/second to slow competitors → detected in <1% of cases → prosecution rare (Sarao, JPMorgan) → manipulation is feature not bug: profitable strategies = algorithmic manipulation → regulator technology generations behind.
