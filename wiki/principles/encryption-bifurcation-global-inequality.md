# Encryption Bifurcation Global Inequality

GPS III rollout (2030-2040) offers civilian M-code access (encrypted, secure) but $500 retrofit per device × $100B total → rich nations mandate M-code receivers (aviation, finance, military) vs poor nations can't afford retrofit stuck on C/A code → when >50% adopt M-code (tipping point 2031-2035) remaining 50% effectively orphaned creating two-tier GPS system (rich encrypted vs poor unencrypted) → consequences cascade: aviation airspace compatibility breaks (encrypted rich nations vs unencrypted poor), maritime collision avoidance fails (ships can't interoperate), finance competitive disadvantage (encrypted banks ±10ns vs unencrypted ±1μs), geopolitical "GPS digital divide" where poor nations locked into BeiDou/GLONASS dependence (China/Russia strategic leverage) → irreversibility where can't roll back to unified C/A (security risk) can't force poor nations to pay (inequality entrenched) creating permanent global bifurcation where solving spoofing vulnerability for rich nations creates new axis of inequality.
