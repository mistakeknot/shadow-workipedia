# Aquifer Contamination Health Environmental Justice

Surface casing corrosion + cement failure + wellbore breach → groundwater contamination pathway → population exposure (Appalachian 750k+ wells 1850s-present, PA/OH/WV, California 250k+ urban/suburban, earthquake casing failure risk) → cancer clusters, respiratory illness → environmental justice (disproportionate rural/poor community impact) → aquifer remediation multi-billion threshold (Ogallala, Edwards vulnerability)
