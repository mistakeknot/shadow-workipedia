# Dependency Ratio Inversion Worker Retiree Economic Impossibility

Demographic aging inverts dependency ratios from historical 8 workers per retiree (1950) to 4:1 (2000) to projected 2:1 (2050 developed nations) and 1.5:1 (2070 China, South Korea), where each worker must support 0.5-0.7 dependents through taxation/transfers requiring 40-60% income redistribution vs historical 15-25%, establishing economic impossibility as required pension/healthcare spending reaches 25-35% GDP (vs current 15-20%) while tax base shrinks creating fiscal gap $10-30T annually across developed economies ensuring either default on elderly commitments or confiscatory taxation on workers.
