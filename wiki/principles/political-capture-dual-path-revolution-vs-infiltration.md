# Political Capture Dual Path Revolution Vs Infiltration

Infiltration path 5-10 years (gradual institutional control, Nazi 1928-1933 model) vs revolution path 12-18 months (Iranian Revolution 1977-1979 model) → threshold: population ≥40% + fanatic loyalty ≥10% enables revolution (0.70 probability), otherwise infiltration path (60 months → 12 months based on capture progress).
