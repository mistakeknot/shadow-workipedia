# Geoengineering Moral Hazard Termination Shock Irreversibility

Permafrost feedback amplification where methane release approaching 1 GtC-eq/year creates runaway threshold if emissions > mitigation capacity producing geoengineering pressure Arctic stratospheric aerosols -0.5 to -1.5°C Arctic cooling $10B-$50B/year vs methane oxidation catalysts 20-50% methane reduction $5B-$20B/year vs carbon removal scale-up (DAC) 1-5 GtCO₂/year removal $100B-$500B/year creating cost-effectiveness trade-off where aerosols cheapest but highest risk and unintended consequences ozone depletion (Montreal Protocol precedent stratospheric chemistry disruption), ecosystem toxicity (methane catalysts spray over wetlands), termination shock if stopped abruptly +2-3°C rapid warming (worse than gradual warming same magnitude due to adaptation lag) demonstrating geoengineering lock-in where once deployed at scale (>5 Tg SO₂/year aerosols threshold) termination shock risk means deployment must continue indefinitely or phase out over decades creating permanent commitment and moral hazard where geoengineering deployed → mitigation pressure drops (political economy "solved climate change" narrative) → emissions continue → eventually termination shock when geoengineering capacity exceeded or runaway warming when feedback dominates demonstrating breakpoint if mitigation efforts drop below geoengineering capacity to compensate producing coordination failure where no binding treaty geoengineering governance enables unilateral deployment risk (single nation acts) triggering 60% sanctions probability from victim countries plus compensation demands but international cooperation required (Arctic Council Russia/Canada/US/Norway/Denmark) encounters geopolitical tensions making multilateral governance impossible creating tragedy-of-commons where first mover captures benefits (reduced permafrost feedback in their region) while imposing costs on all (termination shock risk globally) producing race-to-deploy despite collective catastrophe.
