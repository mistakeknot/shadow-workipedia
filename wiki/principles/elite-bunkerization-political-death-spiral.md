# Elite Bunkerization Political Death Spiral

Inequality >20 Gini enables elite AC bunker retreat (wealthy neighborhoods ±10°C cooler + private backup power + police protection) reducing political pressure for public adaptation (rich unaffected by crisis), creating feedback where elite isolation → reduced climate justice movement strength → policy adoption declines → poor mortality normalized → migration pressure mounts → municipal fiscal collapse → infrastructure underfunding → cascades worsen, making prevention of mass exodus possible only if public infrastructure adopted before bunkerization degree exceeds 0.40 (irreversibility point beyond which political coalition for public goods becomes impossible)
