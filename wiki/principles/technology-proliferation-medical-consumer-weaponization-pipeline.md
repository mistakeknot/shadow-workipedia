# Technology Proliferation Medical Consumer Weaponization Pipeline

BCI technology proliferates from medical applications (Neuralink FDA approval 2023, paralysis treatment) to consumer enhancement (memory augmentation, sensory expansion, direct neural interfaces) with adoption reaching 1M users (2030), 10M (2035), 100M+ (2040) as cost drops from $100K (2025) to $10K (2030) to $1K (2040), where initial medical necessity (epilepsy monitoring, prosthetic control) establishes safety precedent and regulatory approval enabling consumer market expansion that simultaneously creates neural attack surface at population scale and military enhancement pipeline as dual-use technology makes weaponization inevitable.
