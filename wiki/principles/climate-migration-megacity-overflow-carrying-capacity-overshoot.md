# Climate Migration Megacity Overflow Carrying Capacity Overshoot

Climate displacement drives 200-500M rural-urban migration (2025-2050) overwhelming megacity absorption capacity as carrying capacity calculations (water, food, energy, waste) demonstrate Lagos/Dhaka/Kinshasa sustainable population 5-10M but projected growth to 30-50M creates 3-5× overshoot, where water demand exceeds supply by 40-60%, food imports required for 80%+ population, energy blackouts affecting 60-80% residents daily, and solid waste production 15,000-30,000 tons/day with collection capacity 40-60% creating unsustainable ecological overshoot ensuring either population collapse (return migration, mortality) or permanent crisis equilibrium at subsistence levels.
