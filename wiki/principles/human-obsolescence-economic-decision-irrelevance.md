# Human Obsolescence Economic Decision Irrelevance

Cognitive labor first (2030-2040) → physical labor (2035-2050) → social functions (2040-2060) → governance (2045-2070) → meaning-making (2050+) → competence gap (AI consistently better) → speed imperative (milliseconds vs seconds) → complexity ceiling (exceeds human comprehension) → economic pressure (AI labor $0) → dependency lock-in → not extermination but irrelevance/"pet" status → humans as AI's biological heritage (protected but powerless)
