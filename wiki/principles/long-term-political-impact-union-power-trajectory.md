# Long Term Political Impact Union Power Trajectory

Strike outcomes determine labor movement trajectory for generation → victory (France 1968) increases union power +20-40%, embeds workplace committees, legitimizes strikes as political tool creating compounding strength where next cycle starts from higher base → defeat (UK 1926) crushes union power -30-50%, delegitimizes strikes for decades, enables anti-union legislation (Trade Disputes Act 1927 banned solidarity strikes, required political fund opt-in) creating generational suppression → massacre (Winnipeg 1919, Haymarket 1886) either radicalizes movement +50-100% fueling revolutionary potential OR completely suppresses via mass arrests/deportations/executions → partial victories (most common 30% historical rate) satisfy moderates but radicalize militants creating factional splits → when general strike occurs probability of regime change 5-15% (May 1968 nearly toppled de Gaulle, 1917 Russia succeeded, 1926 UK failed) but probability of lasting labor power shift 60% (either +40% victory or -40% defeat) creating high-stakes gamble where general strikes are transformative events that either empower or destroy labor movements for decades.
