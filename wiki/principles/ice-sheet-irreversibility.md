Greenland collapse at >2°C regional warming accelerates rise from 0.0002m/year → 0.003m/year sustained (15× multiplier) committing to +7m over centuries, while West Antarctic instability at >3°C adds +3-5m creating compounding tipping point cascade that no policy intervention can reverse once triggered
