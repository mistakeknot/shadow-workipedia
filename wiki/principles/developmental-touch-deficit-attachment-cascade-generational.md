# Developmental Touch Deficit Attachment Cascade Generational

Children require 400+ touches daily for healthy development → screen-distracted parents delivering 50-100 → insecure attachment +40% → touch-averse children become touch-averse adults → each generation baseline lower → "failure to thrive" expanding beyond orphanages → population-level attachment disorder.
