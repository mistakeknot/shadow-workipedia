# Economic Disruption Supply Chain Propagation

Strike economic impact scales with sector criticality and duration via supply chain cascade → transport shutdown (10× multiplier) day 1 prevents distribution → food shortages (6× multiplier) day 3 as supermarkets empty → fuel depletion (8× multiplier) day 5 as deliveries halt → hospitals run out of supplies (5× multiplier) day 7 creating deaths → GDP impact -2% to -15% per week (France 1968 -10-15%, UK 1926 -5-8%) → business bankruptcy pressure escalates (small firms fail first, large firms after weeks) forcing state intervention → when essential services exempted (hospitals, fire, water) reduces GDP impact 30-40% but maintains public support vs complete shutdown maximizes economic pressure but turns public against strikers creating impossible choice where maximizing leverage minimizes legitimacy.
