# Stablecoin CBDC Substitution Private Public Money War

Stablecoins threaten central bank monetary control → CBDC response: compete or ban → US approach unclear (Fed CBDC research slow, regulation uncertain) → China bans stablecoins, pushes digital yuan → EU MiCA regulation creates licensed stablecoin framework → stablecoin survival depends on regulatory arbitrage → but regulated stablecoins become quasi-CBDCs (surveillance, control) → unregulated stablecoins become shadow money (crime, evasion) → binary outcome: absorption into state system OR permanent shadow finance.
