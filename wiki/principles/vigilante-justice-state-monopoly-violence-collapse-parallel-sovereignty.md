# Vigilante Justice State Monopoly Violence Collapse Parallel Sovereignty

Vigilantism proliferates as state violence monopoly erodes where armed citizens claim authority to enforce laws (border militias, neighborhood patrols, protest confrontations), generating 1,000-5,000 vigilante incidents annually (2030-2040) vs 100-500 historical as self-defense claims legitimize extrajudicial killings (Kyle Rittenhouse precedent), creating parallel sovereignty where 20-40% populations trust armed citizens over police for security and vigilante organizations assume state functions (border control, riot suppression, political enforcement) establishing de facto irregular governance competing with formal authorities.
