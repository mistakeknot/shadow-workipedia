# Immigration Replacement Impossibility Cultural Assimilation Limits

Immigration replacement requires sustained flows 1-3% population annually (Germany needs 400K/year indefinitely, Japan 600K/year to stabilize) but cultural assimilation capacity limits sustainable immigration to 0.3-0.5% annually (historical precedent) as higher rates trigger nativist backlash (2015 Europe 1.5M refugees created political crisis), establishing replacement impossibility where demographic math requires 2-6× higher immigration than social cohesion tolerates creating binary choice between demographic collapse or cultural transformation with 60-80% probability anti-immigration politics prevents replacement migration.
