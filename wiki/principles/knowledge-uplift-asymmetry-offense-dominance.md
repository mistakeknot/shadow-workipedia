# Knowledge Uplift Asymmetry Offense Dominance

AI provides 10-100x capability multiplier to non-experts but only 1.5x to experts → non-expert bioterrorist with AI achieves PhD-equivalent design capability in 6 months vs 20 years → offense dominance because attackers benefit disproportionately (novice → expert) while defenders gain marginal improvement (expert → slightly better expert) → asymmetry ratio worsens with AI capability (2025: 10x, 2035: 50x, 2045: 100x) → democratization of catastrophic capability.
