# ASAT Proliferation Demonstration Normalization Arms Race

Direct-ascent kinetic ASAT capability proliferates from 6+ nations (2024) to 8+ (2030) alongside co-orbital proximity 4+ → 6+, directed energy 2+ → 4+, and cyber attacks 10+ → 15+, where each ASAT test proves deterrent capability while creating debris increasing cascade risk and triggering reciprocal development, normalizing testing (Russia Kosmos-1408 forced ISS emergency shelter 2021) eroding taboo as dual-use technology makes launch capabilities ≈ ASAT capabilities ensuring ungovernable proliferation.
