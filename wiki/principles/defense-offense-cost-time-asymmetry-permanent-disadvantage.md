# Defense Offense Cost Time Asymmetry Permanent Disadvantage

Offense cost $100K (2025) → $10K (2040) via AI design automation, defense cost $100M (2025) → $1B (2040) via universal preparedness → cost ratio improves for offense (1:1000 → 1:100000) → offense time 24 months → 6 months, defense time 12 months → 18 months → time ratio also favors offense → capability ratio 3:1 offense advantage (AI uplift favors attack over defense) → permanent structural disadvantage for defenders.
