# Technology Democratization CRISPR Proliferation Benchtop Weaponization

CRISPR gene editing cost collapses from $10,000 (2012) to $10 (2025) while DNA synthesis drops $10/base to $0.001/base enabling benchtop biology where single actor with $50K equipment and online protocols achieves gain-of-function capabilities previously requiring BSL-4 facilities and $100M budgets, as dual-use technology proliferation reaches 100+ nations (2030), 1,000+ institutions (2035), and 10,000+ individuals with weaponization capability (2040) creating ungovernable diffusion where biological WMD accessibility approaches improvised explosives.
