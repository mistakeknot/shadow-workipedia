# Ocean Acidification Decoupling Coral Fisheries Marine Collapse Irreversible

SAI masks atmospheric warming but doesn't reduce CO₂ absorption by oceans creating fundamental decoupling where surface temperature stabilizes at +1.5-2°C while ocean pH continues dropping from 8.1 (pre-industrial) to 7.8 by 2100 (representing 10-30× natural acidification rate), causing 90% coral reef extinction by 2050 (Pinatubo analog confirmed mechanism), collapsing fisheries supporting 3B people's protein intake, and triggering marine food web cascade within 30-50 years regardless of successful temperature control demonstrating treating symptoms while ignoring root cause guarantees failure.
