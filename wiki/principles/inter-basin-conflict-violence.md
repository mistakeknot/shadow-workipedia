# Inter Basin Conflict Violence

Coastal desal demand growth triggers upstream water transfers (Colorado River → San Diego, Sacramento Delta → Bay Area) requiring infrastructure ($500M-$5B pipelines/canals), causing 30-50% agricultural water rights loss, land value crashes (-40% to -70%), farm bankruptcy probability 0.30-0.60, and environmental damage ($500M-$5B from river desiccation, ecosystem collapse), escalating to violence probability 0.05-0.15 when losses >30% (Owens Valley dynamiting 1920s precedent).
