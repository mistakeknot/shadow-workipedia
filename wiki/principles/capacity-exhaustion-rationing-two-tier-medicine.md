# Capacity Exhaustion Rationing Two Tier Medicine

Hospitals running 85-95% baseline occupancy (zero surge capability) with ICU beds 50-100k vs 300k+ pandemic need creates ER boarding crisis (12-48hr waits for inpatient beds), surgical wait time explosion (6-12 months emerging for non-urgent procedures), and formal rationing protocols (ventilator allocation who lives/dies, triage scoring, age-based cutoffs, quality-adjusted life year calculations, ability-to-pay factors) while wealthy flee to concierge medicine and public system degrades into developing-world conditions creating 20+ year life expectancy gap between rich/poor.
