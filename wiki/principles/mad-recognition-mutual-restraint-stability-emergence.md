# MAD Recognition Mutual Restraint Stability Emergence

MAD conditions: both sides offensive >0.75 + infrastructure vulnerability >0.70 → mutual restraint recognition → escalation willingness drops ×0.3 → low-level conflict normalizes (espionage tolerated, destruction red line) → USA-Russia achieved 2020-2021 (post-SolarWinds: sanctions only, no cyber retaliation despite 18k orgs compromised) → USA-China emerging (asymmetric capability makes MAD unstable) → asymmetric pairs (USA-North Korea) cannot achieve MAD (no mutual vulnerability).
