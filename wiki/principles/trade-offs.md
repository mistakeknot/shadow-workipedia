# Trade Offs

- ✅ Pro: Most effective protection (0.1-0.3% deforestation in demarcated lands vs 2-8% elsewhere)
- ❌ Con: 10-20 year timeline (slow), political firestorm in Brazil (Bancada Ruralista opposition), sustained commitment required
**Outcome Ranges**:
  - Success (50-60%): Demarcation completes by 2045, deforestation drops -30-50%
  - Political Collapse (30-40%): Coup or Bolsonaro 2.0 reverses progress
  - Partial (10-20%): Some territories protected, others invaded
