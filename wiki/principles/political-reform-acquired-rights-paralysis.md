# Political Reform Acquired Rights Paralysis

Every pension reform attempt triggers massive resistance from current beneficiaries (30-40% electorate = retiree voting bloc) invoking "acquired rights" legal doctrine and constitutional protections, creating gridlock where France retirement age 62→64 triggers nationwide strikes, Brazil pension reform causes governability crisis, Italy governments fall over pension changes, and USA Social Security remains "third rail" untouchable despite trust fund depletion 2033-2035 projected, enabling perpetual can-kicking until catastrophic forced adjustment.
