# System State Transition Collapse Trajectory

Human dominant (>70%, <20% PTSD, stable but expensive) → hybrid functional (40-70%, 20-40% PTSD, rising pressure) → trauma crisis (30-60%, >40% PTSD, lawsuits, >50% turnover) → automation pivot (<30% human, >70% AI, accuracy drops, genocide risk) → system collapse (strike + automation failure simultaneous, content floods, regulatory intervention) → genocide facilitation: AI <40% minority language + mass violence = $5B+ fines, criminal liability, forced sale (trajectory bends toward collapse unless structural intervention)
