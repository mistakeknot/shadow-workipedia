# Engagement Maximization Amplification Trap

Platform algorithms optimize for engagement (dwell time, likes, shares) creating 2-6× amplification for controversial/outrageous content, driving echo chamber formation (cross-cutting exposure 40% → 5%) and radicalization pipelines (YouTube 2016-2020 rabbit holes), while content moderation capacity constraints (moderator ratio 1:10,000 to 1:100,000 users, AI accuracy 35-65%, manual review lag 24-72 hours) enable 95-99% false content to evade detection, creating structural amplification bias.
