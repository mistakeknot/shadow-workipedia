# Immunocompromised Population Expansion

COVID-19 created millions of steroid-treated, organ-damaged patients; HIV burden remains high in Africa; chemotherapy survival extends immunosuppression windows; aging demographics swell vulnerable cohorts. Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) kill 1.5M annually already—more than malaria—mostly among the immunocompromised.
