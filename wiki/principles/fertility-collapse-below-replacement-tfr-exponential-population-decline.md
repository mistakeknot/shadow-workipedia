# Fertility Collapse Below Replacement TFR Exponential Population Decline

Total fertility rate (TFR) falls below replacement 2.1 children per woman across 83 nations (2024) including China 1.09, South Korea 0.72, Japan 1.26, Italy 1.24, Spain 1.16, establishing demographic collapse threshold where TFR <1.5 triggers exponential decline as each generation 28% smaller than prior (0.72 TFR = 65% reduction in 25 years), with momentum ensuring population halving every 40-50 years even if fertility recovers creating irreversible generational deficit where 50M births missing (2020-2050 East Asia) can never be retroactively created.
