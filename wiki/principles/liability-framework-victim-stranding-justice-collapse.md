# Liability Framework Victim Stranding Justice Collapse

Fault determination clarity degrades 0.40 (2025) → 0.20 (2045) as L4/L5 crashes create novel liability questions (manufacturer? software vendor? fleet operator? city?) → mandatory arbitration clauses force 70% → 95% of victims out of courts → trial success rate drops 40% → 15% (information asymmetry: victims cannot access crash data logs) → stranded victim count accumulates 50 → 2000+ unable to get compensation → systemic injustice normalized.
