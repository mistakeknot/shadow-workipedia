# Circadian Disruption Melatonin Suppression Health Cascade

Blue light (450-480nm) suppresses melatonin production → LED streetlights 4000K+ shift to high blue content → 3-5 lux at eye level sufficient for circadian disruption (typical bedroom 50-200 lux from streetlights) → melatonin suppression linked to: breast cancer (+30-50% night shift workers), prostate cancer (+30%), obesity (+20%), depression (+40%), diabetes (+30%) → $400B+ annual health costs attributed → children most vulnerable (developing circadian systems) → blue light from devices compounds outdoor exposure.
