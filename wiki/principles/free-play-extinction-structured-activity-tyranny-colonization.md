# Free Play Extinction Structured Activity Tyranny Colonization

Unstructured play time declined 50%+ since 1970s → every hour scheduled (soccer, tutoring, violin) → "resume building" starts at 5 → spontaneous neighborhood play extinct → parents fear child without activities → childhood becomes 16-hour workday → intrinsic motivation destroyed.
