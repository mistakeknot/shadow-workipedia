# Contagion Transmission CeFi DeFi TradFi Bridges

CeFi failure (exchange/lender) → DeFi stress (stablecoin depeg, DEX liquidity drain, oracle manipulation) → TradFi exposure (Grayscale GBTC discount, MicroStrategy margin calls, crypto bank failures: Silvergate, Signature, Silicon Valley Bank 2023) → transmission speed accelerating (2014: weeks, 2022: hours) → firewall effectiveness: DeFi isolation 0.60 (smart contracts don't have counterparty risk same way), TradFi isolation 0.80 (regulatory capital buffers) → systemic risk threshold: crypto market cap >$5T + TradFi exposure >$500B = potential Fed intervention trigger.
