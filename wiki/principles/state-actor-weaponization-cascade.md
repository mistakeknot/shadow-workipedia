# State Actor Weaponization Cascade

Foreign interference operations (Russian IRA $1.25M/month budget reaching 126M Americans 2016, China/Iran analogs $10M-$100M annually) exploit platform vulnerabilities and domestic polarization to destabilize adversaries via election interference, social division amplification, and crisis narrative manipulation (COVID conspiracy theories), with success probability 0.40-0.70 (measured by violence incidents, trust decline, turnout suppression) creating competitive disinformation arms race where defense costs exceed attack costs by 10-100× (fact-checking $50M vs attack budgets $500M-$2B).
