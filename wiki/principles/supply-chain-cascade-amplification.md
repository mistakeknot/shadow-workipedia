# Supply Chain Cascade Amplification

Software supply chain compromise enables mass simultaneous encryption (Kaseya 1,500 businesses July 2021, SolarWinds 18,000 organizations, MOVEit 2,500+ organizations 2023) → single vulnerability exploited → lateral movement across interconnected systems (1 unpatched system → network compromise → domain admin → encrypt everything) → backup systems targeted first (40-50% lack offline backups 2021) → recovery impossibility creates ransom payment pressure → when supply chain attack achieves 1,000+ simultaneous victims total ransom demands reach $70M+ (Kaseya) creating economies of scale for attackers where development cost amortized across thousands of victims.
