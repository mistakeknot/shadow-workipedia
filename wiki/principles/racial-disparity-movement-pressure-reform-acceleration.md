# Racial Disparity Movement Pressure Reform Acceleration

Black-White incarceration disparity 5.1× (2,306 vs 450 per 100k) → drug offense disparity 6× despite similar usage rates → crack-powder 100:1 ratio pre-2010 (reduced 18:1) → racial justice movement strength 0.0-1.0 (2020 BLM peak 0.90) → +20% reform pressure when strength >0.70 → enables abolition-adjacent policies (Philadelphia Krasner -37%, San Francisco Boudin -40% jail population) → fragility: movement decay t½ = 2-4 years (2020 → 2024 decline) + conservative backlash (recall attempts).
