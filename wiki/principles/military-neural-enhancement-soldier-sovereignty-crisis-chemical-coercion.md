# Military Neural Enhancement Soldier Sovereignty Crisis Chemical Coercion

Military BCI adoption for combat enhancement (reaction time 5×, pain suppression 0.95, fear reduction 0.90, fatigue elimination) creates soldier sovereignty crisis as neural modification enables command override of individual will, where combat effectiveness requires surrendering neural autonomy (cannot refuse orders, cannot experience moral hesitation, cannot retain traumatic memories) but reversibility impossible (neural adaptation, dependency, identity dissolution) leaving veterans with permanent cognitive modifications and no legal framework to assign responsibility for war crimes committed under neural compulsion as soldiers become biological drones with human appearance but algorithmic control.
