# Cascading Blackout Normalization Exodus Loop

Major blackouts propagate through interconnected grids in minutes (Northeast 2003: 55M people in 9 minutes, frequency rising 3-4/year 1990s→25+/year 2020s = 8× increase) causing economic losses escalating to $300B+/year when frequency >50 events/year normalizes grid unreliability, triggering business relocation (>20% Fortune 500 citing grid reliability), wealthy microgrid defection (>10% high-income households), utility revenue collapse, and permanent dark zone emergence when >10% service territory abandoned creates 10M+ "grid refugees."
