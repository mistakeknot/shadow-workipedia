# Data Drift Silent Catastrophe

Medical AI trained on 2020 patient data fails on 2025 populations due to demographic shifts, new diseases, drug interactions, and practice pattern changes. Performance degradation is invisible until mortality clusters emerge—models don't announce when they've become dangerously inaccurate. Healthcare AI lacks aviation's mandatory recertification cycles.
