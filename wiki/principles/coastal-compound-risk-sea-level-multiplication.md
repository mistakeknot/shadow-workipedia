# Coastal Compound Risk Sea Level Multiplication

Subsidence 25cm/year + SLR 3mm/year = 28cm/year relative elevation loss (Jakarta) → tidal flooding becomes daily occurrence → drainage systems designed for gravity flow fail → pumping required continuously $100M+/year (Venice) → seawall investment $40B (Great Garuda) cannot keep pace → saltwater intrusion 100-500m/year → well contamination 10-30% brackish within 1-5 years (compound threat multiplicative not additive)
