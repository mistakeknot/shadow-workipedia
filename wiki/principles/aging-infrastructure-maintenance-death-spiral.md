# Aging Infrastructure Maintenance Death Spiral

70% US grid 25+ years old with transformers operating 10-20 years beyond design life creates exponential failure rates when annual emergency repairs exceed 80% of maintenance budget ($2-5T replacement backlog, 12-20 month transformer lead times, 1-2% spare capacity), preventing planned replacements and locking grid into terminal decay where blackout frequency >50 hours/year (vs 4 hours historical) triggers business exodus, utility revenue collapse, and permanent dark zone declarations when restoration costs >5× revenue potential.
