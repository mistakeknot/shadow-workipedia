# Creditor Debtor Geopolitical Realignment Debt Trap Diplomacy Sovereignty Loss

Sovereign debt creates geopolitical leverage where creditor nations (China Belt & Road $1T+ loans, IMF $1T lending) gain control over debtor infrastructure, resource extraction, and policy sovereignty through debt-for-equity swaps, as Sri Lanka Hambantota Port transfer (99-year lease for $1.1B debt relief) demonstrates creditor seizure of strategic assets, establishing debt-trap diplomacy where 70+ Belt & Road nations risk sovereignty loss and potential debt jubilee triggers geopolitical realignment as debtors default on Western institutions while maintaining China obligations or vice versa fragmenting global financial architecture into competing debt spheres.
