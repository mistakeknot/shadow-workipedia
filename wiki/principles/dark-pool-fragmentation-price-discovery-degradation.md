# Dark Pool Fragmentation Price Discovery Degradation

40%+ of trading in dark pools (off-exchange) → price discovery moves to dark → lit markets become toxic (only HFT arb) → fragmentation: 60+ trading venues, quote latency varies → stale quotes exploited → IEX "speed bump" attempt (350μs delay) → exchange competition degrades market quality → complexity enables exploitation → no single point of market oversight → flash events harder to trace.
