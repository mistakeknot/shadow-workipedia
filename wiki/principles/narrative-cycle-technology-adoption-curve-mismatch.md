# Narrative Cycle Technology Adoption Curve Mismatch

Narrative cycles (store of value → payments → smart contracts → DeFi → NFTs → AI tokens) rotate faster than technology delivery → each narrative attracts new capital, peaks, disappoints → underlying technology adoption follows Gartner hype cycle with 5-10 year trough of disillusionment → mismatch creates persistent volatility even as technology matures → resolution: either narratives exhaust (crypto winter permanent) OR technology catches up (utility stabilizes value) → current phase: post-NFT disillusionment, AI narrative emerging, infrastructure maturing.
