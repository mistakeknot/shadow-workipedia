# Engineered Pandemic Extinction Probability Civilization Fragility Threshold

Synthetic biology enables creation of pathogens combining SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility (R0=2-10), Ebola lethality (50-90% CFR), HIV immune evasion (destroys adaptive immunity), and engineered vaccine resistance, where historical pandemic mortality 25-50M (1918 influenza) scales to 500M-2B (2030 population) at comparable CFR but engineered pathogen reaching 80%+ CFR with 60%+ infection rate crosses civilization collapse threshold as 15-30% population loss triggers infrastructure cascade (food production, healthcare, governance) with probability 0.001-0.01 annual creating cumulative 3-28% extinction risk by 2100.
