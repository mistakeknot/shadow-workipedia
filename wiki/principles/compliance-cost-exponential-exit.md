# Compliance Cost Exponential Exit

Multi-region compliance costs scale exponentially (3 regions = 4-6x single region, 5 regions = 10-15x) due to incompatible requirements, triggering corporate exit when (compliance cost / annual revenue) exceeds 0.30-0.50 threshold (Google China 2010 at 0.40), fragmenting global platforms into regional monopolies while startup failure rates increase +20% to +40% from runway exhaustion.
