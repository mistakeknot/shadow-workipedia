# Antibiotic Dependency Resistance Breeding Last Resort Extinction

70% of antibiotics globally go to livestock (63,000 tons/year US alone) for growth promotion and prophylaxis creating selection pressure breeding resistance, mcr-1 colistin resistance spread from Chinese pigs to 30+ countries in 6 months (2015-2016), livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA ST398) endemic in pig farms with 47% US farm workers carrying resistant bacteria, eliminating "last resort" antibiotics for human medicine as agricultural overuse creates untreatable infections.
