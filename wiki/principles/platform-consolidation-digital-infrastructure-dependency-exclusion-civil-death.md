# Platform Consolidation Digital Infrastructure Dependency Exclusion Civil Death

Digital platform consolidation creates essential infrastructure where 5 companies (Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft) mediate 80%+ digital interactions (search, social media, cloud storage, commerce, communication) and payment processors (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal) control 90%+ electronic transactions, establishing platform dependency where exclusion from these services constitutes civil death as 95%+ modern life requires digital access (banking, employment, healthcare, education, social connection), and platform Terms of Service enable unilateral exclusion without due process creating private governance where corporations wield state-like power over digital existence.
