# Nosocomial Infection Healthcare Worker Exodus Hospital Death Zones

Hospital-acquired infection rates explode 5%→30-40% as ICU ventilator-associated pneumonia becomes untreatable and emergency departments function as disease exchanges, driving healthcare worker occupational infection without antibiotic prophylaxis (nursing turnover 17%→50%+, physicians flee to telemedicine), malpractice insurance withdrawal (infection = uninsurable), hospital financial collapse from elective procedure revenue loss (90% revenue vanishes), mass rural hospital closures, and population hospital avoidance behavior creating medical dark zones and home care resurgence (home birth, family caregiving, death at home normalized).
