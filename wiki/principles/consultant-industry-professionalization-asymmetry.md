# Consultant Industry Professionalization Asymmetry

Union avoidance consultant industry growth $5M (1970s) → $340M (2020) creates professionalized anti-union warfare (Burke Group, Ogletree Deakins, LRI) with campaign pricing $10k small facility → $1M mega-facility → $10M Amazon JFK8 → employer adoption 80% large firms, 60% medium, 30% small by 2020 → consultant-advised campaigns achieve 20-40% swing in election outcomes (pre-campaign intervention reduces organizing interest 30-60%) vs amateur worker organizing → legal shield mechanics (consultants advise, employers execute, consultants avoid NLRB liability) creating permanent professionalization gap where $340M industry R&D constantly develops new tactics (vulnerability assessments, predictive analytics, supervisor training) faster than workers can adapt enabling systematic suppression where consultant expertise compounds across thousands of campaigns while worker knowledge resets with each local struggle.
