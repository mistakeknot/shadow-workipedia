# Death Literacy Collapse Clinical Dysfunction Autonomy Loss

Modern populations possess minimal death literacy as death medicalized and removed from home/community (95% deaths in hospitals/care facilities vs 5% home), where advance directives completion rates 30-40% and DNR discussions avoided by 80% physicians until crisis, creating clinical dysfunction where 60-80% end-of-life care contradicts patient preferences (aggressive treatment vs desired comfort care), and autonomy loss as families/physicians override wishes leading to unwanted interventions costing $50-150K per patient and generating massive suffering through treatment patients explicitly rejected when competent.
