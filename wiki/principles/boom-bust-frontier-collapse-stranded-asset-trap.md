# Boom Bust Frontier Collapse Stranded Asset Trap

Agribusiness frontier expansion 1970-2025 (10% → 20% deforestation) produces economic boom (soy/beef export revenues $100B-$200B/year, 25% Brazilian GDP directly/indirectly agriculture-dependent) but vegetation-rainfall feedback means frontier collapses when rainfall reduction -20-40% causes crop failure (soy requires 1200-1500mm/year, beef pasture 1000mm minimum) creating stranded assets where $500B-$1T land/infrastructure investment (cleared land, roads, processing facilities, ports) becomes economically worthless when rainfall insufficient for agriculture producing boom-bust cycle where 2025-2040 continued deforestation toward 25% threshold maintains short-term profitability → 2040-2060 rainfall collapse triggers agricultural failure → 2060-2080 frontier abandonment as investors flee but irreversibility means abandoned land cannot reforest (rainfall <1500mm prevents regeneration) creating permanent degraded savanna generating no economic value demonstrating intertemporal misallocation where present profit maximization (deforest for cattle/soy) destroys future productivity (rainfall-dependent agriculture impossible) but discounting (2-5%/year) makes rational to extract now accept future collapse and first-mover advantage where initial deforesters profit maximally (virgin forest → agricultural land 10-50× ROI 2000-2020) while late deforesters (2030-2040) suffer collapse (investment → stranded assets 2040-2060) creating perverse incentive race-to-clear before tipping point despite collective catastrophe.
