# Shelter Paradox Mass Death

Animal shelters face impossible math—3-4 million animals enter US shelters annually, only 2 million are adopted, and "no-kill" targets (>90% save rate) require space and resources that don't exist, resulting in 1.5 million euthanized annually while shelters deny intake and streets fill with strays.
