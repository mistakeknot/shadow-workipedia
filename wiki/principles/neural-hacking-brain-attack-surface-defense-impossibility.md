# Neural Hacking Brain Attack Surface Defense Impossibility

BCI creates unprecedented attack surface as brain lacks firewall mechanisms (no authentication, no intrusion detection, no security updates) where successful neural interface hack enables memory manipulation (implant false memories, erase real ones), sensory deception (inject hallucinations indistinguishable from reality), motor control (forced movements), and cognitive disruption (attention hijacking, emotion manipulation), with defense impossibility as brain cannot distinguish legitimate from malicious neural signals and attack detection requires victim awareness of tampering but neural hacking can suppress awareness itself creating perfect exploitation where victim has zero security mechanisms against brain compromise.
