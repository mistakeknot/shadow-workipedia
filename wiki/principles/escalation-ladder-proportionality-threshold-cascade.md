# Escalation Ladder Proportionality Threshold Cascade

Four-level escalation: Espionage (SolarWinds 18k orgs) → Disruption (Colonial Pipeline 6 days) → Destruction (Ukraine grid 225k blacked out, NotPetya $10B) → Kinetic Retaliation (threshold: >100 casualties OR >$1B damage OR nuclear C3I intrusion) → proportionality requirement varies by doctrine (0.30 Aggressive to 0.90 Treaty) → escalation spiral feedback -0.08 norms per cycle until MAD recognition (>0.75 both sides) halts at ×0.3 probability.
