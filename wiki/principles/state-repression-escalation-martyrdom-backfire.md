# State Repression Escalation Martyrdom Backfire

Government response follows 8-step escalation ladder (ignore → negotiate → limited police → mass arrests → military deployment → martial law → live fire → massacre) → each step has martyrdom probability where violence radicalizes movement (Winnipeg 1919 "Bloody Saturday" 2 deaths created lasting martyrs, France 1968 police brutality nearly toppled government) OR breaks it (UK 1926 volunteer strikebreakers + military logistics defeated strike with minimal violence) → military effectiveness varies (professional 80-95% but mutiny risk, conscript 40-70% sympathize with workers, police 60-80% but outnumbered) → regime type determines escalation speed (democracies hesitate, autocracies immediate crackdown) → when repression exceeds legitimacy threshold (massacre >10 deaths, mass arrests >1,000) international intervention probability 30-50% but if violence remains limited (<5 deaths) state maintains legitimacy creating perverse incentive where measured repression succeeds but excessive violence risks regime collapse.
