# Fertilizer Dependency Diminishing Returns Death Spiral

Yield per kg fertilizer declining since 1990s (grain yield growth 2-3%/year 1960-1990→0.9-1.3% 1990-2020) despite fertilizer use +300% since 1960s, creating economic trap where fertilizer costs >50% farm operating expenses, environmental damage (runoff dead zones), soil biology collapse (0-90% killed), and productivity plateau followed by decline when organic matter <1.5%, driving land abandonment >10% former cropland and dust storm frequency increases (1930s Dust Bowl analog: 2.5M displaced, 100M acres damaged, 850M tons topsoil lost).
