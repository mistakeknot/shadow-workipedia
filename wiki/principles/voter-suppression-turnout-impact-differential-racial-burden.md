# Voter Suppression Turnout Impact Differential Racial Burden

Strict photo ID laws -2-3% overall turnout, -5-6% minority (2× disparity) → polling place closures -1-2% in affected areas → same-day registration removal -3-5% → purge programs 1-5% wrongful removal → cumulative suppression -5-15% targeted demographics → skewed electoral outcomes → gerrymandered majorities entrench → further suppression legislation (suppression creates electoral advantage, enables further suppression, self-reinforcing cycle, compound effects across tactics)
