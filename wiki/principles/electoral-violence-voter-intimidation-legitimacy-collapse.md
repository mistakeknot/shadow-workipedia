# Electoral Violence Voter Intimidation Legitimacy Collapse

Electoral violence escalates from isolated incidents to systematic intimidation where armed groups monitor polls (2020 US precedent), election workers receive death threats (60% US election officials 2022), and post-election violence protests turn violent 40-60% probability vs historical <10%, creating legitimacy collapse where losing sides refuse to concede (2020 US Capitol attack precedent) and electoral outcomes determined by violence capacity not vote counts as mob intimidation achieves 5-15% voter suppression in contested districts ensuring election results reflect violence equilibrium not democratic preference.
