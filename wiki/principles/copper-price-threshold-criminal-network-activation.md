# Copper Price Threshold Criminal Network Activation

Copper exceeding $8,000/ton activates opportunistic theft → $10,000/ton mobilizes organized networks → $12,000/ton professionalizes operations with insider recruitment → price-theft elasticity 2-5× increase per 50% price rise → global market $1B+ annual theft value → scrap recycler laundering 4-48hr export (price signals reliably predict theft waves, copper futures as security metric)
