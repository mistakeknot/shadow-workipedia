Protracted displacement >5yr triggers camp permanence → 17+ year median duration → Cox's Bazar 900k (2017→2024), Dadaab 33 years, Palestinian camps 76 years 5.9M registered → camp-born population 30-50% majority never knew origin country → urbanization (markets, schools, parallel governance) → integration politically impossible, return legally impossible, closure structurally impossible (generational irreversibility)
