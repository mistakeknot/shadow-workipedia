# Resilience Investment Futility Permanent Asymmetry Satellite Vulnerability

Satellite hardening costs $50-200M per asset (25-100% increase prohibitive for commercial, acceptable military but reduces fleet size) while constellation resilience approaches like Starlink 10,000 cheap ($500K) satellites vs traditional 100 expensive ($500M) still vulnerable to Kessler cascade, where ground alternatives (fiber $50K/km, eLoran $10B+ rebuild achieving only 90% GPS accuracy, stratospheric balloons weather-dependent) remain inferior, ensuring even $500B-2T resilience investment cannot overcome permanent asymmetry as attacker creates cascade in seconds making space domain permanently ungovernable.
