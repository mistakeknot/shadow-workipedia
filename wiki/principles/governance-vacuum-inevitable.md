# Governance Vacuum Inevitable

No existing legal framework adequately addresses sovereignty, property rights, criminal jurisdiction, or democratic representation for off-world settlements, creating governance crises from day one—measured by treaty applicability disputes (Outer Space Treaty ambiguity), corporate vs. national authority conflicts, and colonial-metropolitan representation ratio (initial 0%, versus American Revolution trigger of "no taxation without representation").
