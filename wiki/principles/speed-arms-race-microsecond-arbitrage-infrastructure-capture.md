# Speed Arms Race Microsecond Arbitrage Infrastructure Capture

HFT firms spend $300M+ on microsecond advantages (cross-Atlantic cables, microwave towers, co-location) → latency arbitrage: see order 10-100μs before execution → guaranteed profit → 50-70% of US equity volume is HFT → exchange revenue dependent on HFT data fees → regulatory capture: exchanges sell speed advantages → market structure designed for HFT, not price discovery → retail orders are product, not participant → fundamental investors disadvantaged by speed tax on every transaction.
