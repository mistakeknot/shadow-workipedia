# Cemetery Capacity Exhaustion Burial Impossibility Urban Crisis

Urban cemetery capacity approaches exhaustion as land scarcity (New York 3 years remaining capacity 2020, London 20 years) meets exponentially growing death rates, where traditional burial requires 10-15 sq ft per grave but cities have <5% available land and expansion politically/economically impossible ($10M+ per acre urban land), forcing transition to cremation (rises from 50% US 2020 to projected 80% 2040) or vertical burial (Singapore high-rise columbarium) but cultural/religious resistance (Judaism, Islam prohibit cremation) creates burial crisis where 20-40% deaths cannot be accommodated through preferred methods.
