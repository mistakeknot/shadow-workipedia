# Rent To Own Triple Retail Poverty Tax Normalization

Can't afford $800 couch upfront → rent-to-own at $100/month for 36 months = $3,600 → 3x retail price normalized for poor → appliances, furniture, electronics all rent-to-own → "providing access" rhetoric masks extraction → generational cycle (parents and children both trapped).
