# Repair Bottleneck Ship Vulnerability Permanent Partition Zones Maritime Warfare

60 global repair ships can fix 2-4 cables/month maximum but require 2-6 weeks per cable plus 1-4 weeks transit time, creating repair capacity overwhelm when adversary cuts 10+ cables simultaneously, while repair ship vulnerability (unarmed civilian vessels, easily sunk by fishing vessel ramming or small arms fire) enables attacks making commercial repair impossible without military escort, escalating cable warfare to conventional naval warfare and creating permanent partition zones where cables remain unrepaired indefinitely forcing 10× slower satellite alternatives with 20-100× higher latency breaking HFT and real-time systems.
