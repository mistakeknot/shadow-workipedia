# Rhetoric Radicalization Pipeline Online Offline Action Conversion

Political violence emerges from radicalization pipeline where extremist rhetoric exposure (conspiracy theories, dehumanization, eliminationist language) on social media platforms reaches 30-50% populations creating radicalization pool of 100M-200M globally, where 1-5% progress from passive consumption to active participation and 0.01-0.1% commit violence, establishing conversion funnel where 10,000-100,000 violent actors emerge from millions exposed to radicalizing content as online rhetoric translates to offline action through algorithmic amplification and echo chamber reinforcement.
