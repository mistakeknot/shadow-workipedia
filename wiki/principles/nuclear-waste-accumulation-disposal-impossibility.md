# Nuclear Waste Accumulation Disposal Impossibility

Spent fuel accumulation 300,000 metric tons globally (+10,000-12,000 tons/year) but no permanent disposal solution exists → US 90,000 metric tons (80 sites, 50,000 tons wet storage pools, 40,000 tons dry casks) → Yucca Mountain $15B spent 1998-2010, cancelled 2010, $7B+ damages paid to utilities, $750M/year ongoing payments, 1998 deadline missed by 20+ years → wet storage pools designed for 10-20 year temporary storage now hold 30-50 year accumulation at 3-4× design capacity → when pool capacity exhausted dry cask storage costs $1M-3M per cask × 3,000+ casks = $3B-9B unfunded liability → political gridlock (NIMBY opposition, Nevada veto, no alternative sites) perpetuates indefinite on-site storage where radioactive inventory accumulates without disposal pathway creating permanent custodial burden.
