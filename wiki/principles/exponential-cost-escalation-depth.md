# Exponential Cost Escalation Depth

Each 100 feet of well depth increase doubles pumping energy costs while drilling costs rise exponentially ($5,000 at 100ft [1950s] → $150,000 at 800ft [today] → $300,000 at 1,200ft [projected]), creating economic discontinuity where wells suddenly produce nothing when static water level crosses 1,000-1,500ft pumping threshold.
