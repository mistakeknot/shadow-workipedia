# Post Shooting Gun Sales Surge Feedback Loop

Mass shooting event → fear + political rhetoric → gun sales spike (39.7M background checks 2020 record) → more firearms in circulation → higher baseline deaths → next mass shooting triggers another surge → self-reinforcing cycle (massacres increase guns which increases massacres, fear drives proliferation, political deadlock ensures repetition, system optimized for gun industry profit not public safety)
