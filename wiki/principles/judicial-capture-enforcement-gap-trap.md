# Judicial Capture Enforcement Gap Trap

Religious influence 0.80 → judicial independence collapses to 0.20 → plaintiff success drops to 0.15, creating enforcement gap (1.0 - enforcementRate) >0.70 where de jure constitutional rights exist but de facto persecution persists as police don't enforce (complicity 0.60-0.80 in NC/NP states) and mob violence unpunished, India exemplar: Constitution guarantees freedom, Supreme Court protects minorities, but police ignore rulings = minorities learn courts performative → litigation -50% → emigration intent +15%, trap persists because majority benefits from impunity and international pressure (5% max weight) insufficient to mobilize political will for judicial autonomy
