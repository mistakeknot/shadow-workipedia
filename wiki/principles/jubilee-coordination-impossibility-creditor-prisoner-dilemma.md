# Jubilee Coordination Impossibility Creditor Prisoner Dilemma

Coordinated debt forgiveness faces fundamental impossibility as creditors (sovereign bondholders, IMF, World Bank, commercial banks) hold $100T claims but forgiveness creates moral hazard (incentivizes future defaults) and coordination failure (each creditor benefits from others forgiving while maintaining own claims), where historical precedent (German debt forgiveness 1953: 50% haircut enabled recovery) suggests 40-60% forgiveness required but achieving coordination across 195 creditor nations with conflicting interests probabilistically approaches 0% absent crisis forcing cooperation creating binary outcome where either uncoordinated cascade occurs or forced jubilee under collapse conditions.
