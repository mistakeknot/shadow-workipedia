# Grievance Accumulation Trust Violation Violence Threshold

Each denial erodes trust (~0.5 points) → harm/death multipliers (3× harm, 10× death) → bad faith denials (overturned on appeal) 2× erosion → collective grievance index accumulates → media visibility amplifies spread → assassination threshold 85+ grievance → public reaction 10% "hero", 24% "neither" = 34% sympathy for violence (trust violations accumulate to violence, social contract breach, insurance executives targeted, civilizational signal)
