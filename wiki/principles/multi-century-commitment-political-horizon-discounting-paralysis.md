# Multi Century Commitment Political Horizon Discounting Paralysis

Gene drive ecosystem reorganization 30-50 years, genetic caste consolidation 2060-2080, speciation risk 2100 operate on multi-century timescales encountering political horizons 2-4 year election cycles vs 30-year commitment decision window producing politician incentive ignore long-term (voters punish present costs don't reward prevented future disasters) where gene drive deployment malaria eradication benefits immediate 600,000 deaths/year prevented but ecosystem collapse costs delayed 10-30 years and designer baby bans impose present enforcement costs $10-50B/year surveillance, prosecution while genetic inequality costs manifest 2060-2080 creating economic discounting where standard 2-3% discount rate transforms $10T genetic caste damage 2080 into $1-2T present value 2025 systematically underweighting future catastrophe and intergenerational equity failure where current generation consumes gene drive benefits (disease elimination, agricultural pest control) and enhancement benefits (competitive offspring), future generations pay ecosystem collapse (biodiversity loss $5-20B/year per region, pollination services lost) and caste consolidation (social mobility destroyed, governance legitimacy collapsed) but future generations cannot vote today's elections creating representation asymmetry and moral hazard cascade where each decade's delay (2025, 2030, 2035) enables continued benefits while marginally increasing future catastrophe but irreversibility threshold crossed 2040-2050 where gene drive hemispheric spread, biosafety regime collapse, genetic caste consolidated becomes locked demonstrating permanent regret equilibrium where optimal action was 2025-2035 precautionary bans but political economy systematically prevents timely response producing inevitable catastrophe.
