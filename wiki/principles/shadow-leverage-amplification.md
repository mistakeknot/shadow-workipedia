# Shadow Leverage Amplification

Shadow banking non-regulated leverage of 20-50× creates 3-5× deposit multiplier amplification where $1 unit of central bank money generates $25-50 in shadow credit, inflating asset prices 200-500% above fundamentals, but leverage unwinding during stress periods collapses valuations 60-80% in 6-12 months, destroying collateral and triggering 10-20× velocity reversals (2008 US housing: peak-to-trough 65% decline across 4 years, leveraged positions 85% losses)
