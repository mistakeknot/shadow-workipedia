# International Recognition Normative Precedent Cascade

UN recognition requires 2/3 majority → if recognized, international legitimacy +0.40 for ALL AI cults globally (normative shift) → Taliban 1996-2001 recognized by only 3 states (isolation model) vs Palestinian Authority 2012 observer status 138-9 vote (legitimization model), Security Council P5 veto creates gridlock.
