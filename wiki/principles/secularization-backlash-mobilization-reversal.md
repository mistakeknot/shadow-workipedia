# Secularization Backlash Mobilization Reversal

Secularization >60% threshold (USA 65% 2020, France 75%, Sweden 80%) triggers guaranteed fundamentalist backlash (Moral Majority 1979, Trump Christian nationalism 2016, Poland PiS 2015, India BJP 2014) where cultural pressure (20% weight) + ideology capture (40% weight) overwhelm moderate forces with cycle length 30-40 years, but outrage from massacres (democracies only—secular mobilization 0.70 after Christchurch 51 dead 2019, Charleston 9 dead 2015, Pittsburgh 11 dead 2018) generates temporary reform window before outrage decays 10%/month (returning to baseline 12-18 months), making permanent reversal impossible without sustained minority mobilization (interfaith solidarity 0.0-0.80 strength) and fiscal investment in pluralism infrastructure—but international pressure alone (5% max weight) insufficient to prevent democratic backsliding once ideology capture >0.40
