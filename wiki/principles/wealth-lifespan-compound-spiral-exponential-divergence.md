# Wealth Lifespan Compound Spiral Exponential Divergence

More wealth → access to treatments → longer lifespan → more time to accumulate wealth → more wealth → better treatments → even longer lifespan → R1 reinforcing loop exponential divergence → 2080: permanent gerontocracy + biological apartheid → terminal states: revolutionary overthrow OR permanent apartheid OR assassination equilibrium OR technology breakthrough (universal access) OR civilizational collapse (generational warfare destroys infrastructure) → most likely: stratified longevity accepted as "normal" (new feudalism)
