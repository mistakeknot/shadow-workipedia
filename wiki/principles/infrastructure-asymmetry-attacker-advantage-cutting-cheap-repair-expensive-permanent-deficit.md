# Infrastructure Asymmetry Attacker Advantage Cutting Cheap Repair Expensive Permanent Deficit

99% intercontinental data flows through ~500 cables lying unguarded on ocean floor where cutting costs $10,000 and takes 10 minutes using fishing trawler with grappling hook while repair costs $1-5M and takes 2-6 weeks with 60 ships globally providing 2-4 cables/month maximum capacity, creating 100:1 attacker advantage where adversary can cut 10+ cables/month indefinitely faster than defender can repair ensuring permanent vulnerability as defensive investment ($150-300M per cable, 2-4 years construction) always behind offensive capability ($10K equipment, 10 minutes execution).
