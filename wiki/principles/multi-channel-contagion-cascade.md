# Multi Channel Contagion Cascade

Banking crisis (NPL >15%) triggers simultaneous currency collapse (-20-40%), trade credit freeze (bilateral flows -60-80%), and capital flight (-$10-50B per week) creating compound shock where real GDP contracts 5-15% in year one, unemployment spikes 5-15 percentage points, and sovereign default probability rises multiplicatively from <5% to >50% within 12-18 months, demonstrated by Asian Financial Crisis 1997-1998 (Thailand -10.2%, Indonesia -13.1%, Korea -5.8% all in single year)
