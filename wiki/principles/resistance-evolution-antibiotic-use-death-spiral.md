# Resistance Evolution Antibiotic Use Death Spiral

Bacteria evolve 500,000× faster than humans (20-minute generation time vs 25-year human reproduction) with hypermutator strains exhibiting 100-1000× higher mutation rates under antibiotic stress, creating arms race asymmetry where every dose creates selective pressure breeding resistance faster than pharmaceutical industry can develop replacements (penicillin resistance <1% 1940→90% S. aureus 1960, MRSA detected 1961→30-50% infections today), compounded by wastewater treatment plants and hospital effluent functioning as resistance gene hotspots with international travel/trade spreading resistance globally, driving inexorable march toward pan-drug resistant (PDR) and totally drug-resistant (TDR) bacteria.
