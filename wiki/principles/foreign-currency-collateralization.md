# Foreign Currency Collateralization

Developing nations borrow in dollars/euros/yuan for projects generating local currency revenue; currency depreciation (common during construction delays) can double debt burden overnight—Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port borrowed $1.5B at 6.3% interest, then ceded 99-year lease when unable to repay.
