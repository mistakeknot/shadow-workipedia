# Communication Lag Autonomy Force

4-24 minute one-way communication delay makes real-time Earth control impossible, forcing local decision-making that gradually establishes de facto autonomy regardless of de jure authority—measured by communication round-trip time (8-48 minutes), emergency response autonomous decision window, and Earth-intervention feasibility index (approaching zero for time-sensitive matters).
