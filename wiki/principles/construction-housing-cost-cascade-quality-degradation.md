# Construction Housing Cost Cascade Quality Degradation

Sand prices +300-500% in scarce regions 2010-2023 → India 30% construction cost increase in restricted zones → Singapore import bans raised costs 20% → manufactured sand adoption 15% globally (rising 8%/year) → sand = 25-35% of concrete by volume → scarcity pressure + weak quality control → substandard material substitution → structural failures → liability crisis (hidden until catastrophic failure, buildings collapse years later)
