# API Concentration Outsourcing Single Point Failure

China 40% global API production + 80-90% antibiotics + India 20% API (but 70% from China) → US/EU domestic <10% → cost arbitrage (China/India labor 10-20% US wages, lax environmental standards) + profit maximization (generic margins 2-5%, quarterly earnings pressure) → last US penicillin plant closed 2004 → single facility = 50% US heparin supply (fire/inspection/export ban = immediate shortage, 12-36mo to qualify alternative, privatized profits socialized vulnerability)
