# Constitutional Carry Cascade Regulatory Floor Collapse

Heller (2008) + McDonald (2010) + Bruen (2022) Supreme Court rulings → constitutional carry states 0→27 (2010→2024) → permitless concealed carry majority → may-issue struck down → background check gaps persist → "good guy with gun" myth (3% mass shootings stopped by armed civilian) → race to bottom (court absolutism eliminates state authority, regulatory floor collapses, permit requirements unconstitutional trajectory)
