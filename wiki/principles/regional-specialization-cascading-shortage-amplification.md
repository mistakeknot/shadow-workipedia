# Regional Specialization Cascading Shortage Amplification

Food supply chain brittleness (3-day supermarket inventory down from 7-14 days 1960s, strategic reserves 90+ days→15-30 days, California 90% USA leafy greens + 75% fruits/nuts single-region failure risk) combined with climate shock >20% national production loss triggers panic buying +50-200% demand spike, price surge +40-150%, hoarding→empty shelves→rationing when simultaneous failures 3+ major breadbaskets (USA, Ukraine, India, China, Brazil) reduce global production >25% and import dependencies >40% for vulnerable nations (Egypt, Yemen, Bangladesh).
