# Criminalization Revolving Door Fiscal Trap

Criminalization policy → sweep frequency = criminalization × 1000/year → arrest rate = 200 per 1000 homeless/year → 3-day jail → 80% re-arrest within 6 months → cost $50k/person/year (LA 48k unsheltered × $50k = $2.4B/year) exceeding total municipal homeless budget, creating fiscal unsustainability where enforcement bankruptcy forces shift to Housing First despite political opposition
