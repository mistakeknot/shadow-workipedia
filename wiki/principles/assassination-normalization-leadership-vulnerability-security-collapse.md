# Assassination Normalization Leadership Vulnerability Security Collapse

Political assassination probability increases from baseline 0.01 events per election cycle to 0.1-0.5 by 2030-2040 across democracies as protective norms erode, security gaps widen (elected officials receive minimal protection, soft targets numerous), and radicalization pool expands, where successful assassinations (Japan Shinzo Abe 2022, UK Jo Cox 2016) demonstrate vulnerability and inspire copycat attempts creating leadership security collapse where 20-40% elected officials face credible threats forcing either heavy security costing $1-5M per politician or withdrawal from public life delegitimizing democratic participation.
