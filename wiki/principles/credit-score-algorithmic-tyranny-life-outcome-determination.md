# Credit Score Algorithmic Tyranny Life Outcome Determination

Credit scores determine life trajectories where FICO 300-850 range controls access to housing (landlords require 650+), employment (40% employers check credit), insurance rates (50-100% premium differential), and loan terms ($100K-300K additional lifetime interest costs low vs high score), creating algorithmic tyranny as opaque proprietary algorithms (FICO formula secret) make irrevocable judgments affecting 200M+ Americans with error rates 20-25% and systematic bias against poor/minority populations, while credit bureau breaches (Equifax 2017 affecting 147M) create permanent vulnerability as stolen identity enables financial fraud but victims bear burden of proof.
