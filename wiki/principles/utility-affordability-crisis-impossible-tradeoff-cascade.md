# Utility Affordability Crisis Impossible Tradeoff Cascade

Energy burden >10% of income for 30% of households → heating/cooling vs food/medicine tradeoffs → average utility bill $150-300/month → disconnection for $200 arrears → 20M households at shutoff risk → Detroit water shutoffs 100,000+ affected → utility debt = homelessness cascade trigger.
