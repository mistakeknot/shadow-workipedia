# Informal Settlement Proliferation Slum Majority Parallel Governance

Urban growth concentrates in informal settlements where 1.1B slum residents (2020) grows to 2-3B (2050) representing 30-50% megacity population (Nairobi 60%, Mumbai 55%, Lagos 70%), as formal housing production 100K-500K units annually cannot match demand 1-2M units creating permanent housing deficit where slums become majority urban form, establishing parallel governance as state absence (police 1 per 5,000 residents vs 1 per 500 formal areas) enables gang control, religious authority, or community councils providing security/justice/services creating de facto autonomous zones ungoverned by state.
