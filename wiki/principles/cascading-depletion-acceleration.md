# Cascading Depletion Acceleration

Multi-dam systems compound impacts non-linearly with each additional dam increasing operational flexibility 10%, sediment trapping accumulating to 70%+ blocking downstream fertility, and cumulative evaporation losses compounding at 5-8% per reservoir, while overlapping aquifer drawdown cones from adjacent wells accelerate exhaustion beyond individual well impacts.
