# Price Theft Investment Vulnerability Feedback Spiral

Copper price rises → theft increases → legitimate supply disrupted → price rises further → theft more profitable → repair costs consume maintenance budget → deferred maintenance → more vulnerable infrastructure → easier theft → accelerating degradation (positive feedback until price collapse OR security response, no stable equilibrium)
