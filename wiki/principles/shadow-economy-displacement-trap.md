# Shadow Economy Displacement Trap

Formal employment exit (Long COVID severity × zero accommodation availability → 100% exit risk for severe cases) + SSDI denial/delay (50-70% initial denial, 12-24 month wait) creates financial desperation corridor forcing informal economy entry → shadow workforce growth (200K-600K chronically ill, 10-15% of Long COVID labor exits) in remote gigs/grey market services earning 30-60% previous income with zero benefits/protections → legitimacy battles where "they're working under the table" narratives undermine disability claims while "system failed them" counter-narratives lack political traction → permanent underclass formation representing 5-10% population in precarious existence.
