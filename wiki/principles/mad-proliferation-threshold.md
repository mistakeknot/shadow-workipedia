# MAD Proliferation Threshold

Second-strike nuclear capability creates 95% conflict reduction between nuclear powers, while proliferation probability increases exponentially above critical threat threshold (threatLevel >2.5 triggers 40-60% acquisition within 10 years, <2.0 yields <5%), with security guarantees from nuclear allies reducing proliferation by 85-95%.
