# Labor Dependency Enforcement Paradox

Undocumented population growth (3M 1990 → 11M 2007 peak → 10.5M 2023) drives sectoral labor penetration (agriculture 50-70%, construction 15-25%, hospitality 10-20%) creating structural economic dependency → employers cannot hire at prevailing wages (wage suppression 20-40% below market creates profit margins) → mass deportation would cause agriculture output collapse -30-60%, construction slowdown -15-30%, food price spikes +5-10% → business lobbies resist enforcement creating political gridlock where economic incentives favor status quo but political pressure demands deportation creating unsustainable stalemate.
