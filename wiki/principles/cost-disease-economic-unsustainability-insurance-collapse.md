# Cost Disease Economic Unsustainability Insurance Collapse

Healthcare cost explosion (18% GDP 2023 = $4.3T growing 6%/year vs 3% economy) makes family insurance $23,000/year (30% median income) driving medical bankruptcy epidemic (#1 cause, 530,000 families/year) and insurance death spiral where premium growth→healthy dropout→risk pool deterioration→higher premiums→more dropout, while hospital margins collapse to 1-3% (many negative post-COVID) from Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement cuts and administrative overhead waste (25-30% of spending) creates mathematically unsustainable trajectory toward complete system insolvency.
