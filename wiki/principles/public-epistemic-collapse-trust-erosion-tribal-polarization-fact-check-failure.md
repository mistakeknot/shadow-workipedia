# Public Epistemic Collapse Trust Erosion Tribal Polarization Fact Check Failure

Trust in mainstream verification sources falls below 40% threshold triggering irreversible epistemological fracture where 40-60% of population believes different base realities (partisan tribal epistemologies), where fact-checks reach <10% of deepfake audience and are believed by only 30-60% of those reached (tribal identity stronger than evidence), creating permanent information warfare advantage where deepfakes aligned with audience priors believed 60-80% of time while authentic content contradicting priors rejected 40-60% of time, making correction impossible and enabling governance collapse when shared factual reality no longer exists.
