# State Weakness Cascade

When one state fails (Somalia 1991, Libya 2011, Mali 2012), arms, fighters, and instability flow across porous borders to destabilize neighbors in predictable cascading patterns, with median transmission time of 18-36 months—measured by state fragility contagion index and cross-border weapons flow (Libyan arsenal dispersal reached 14 countries within 3 years).
