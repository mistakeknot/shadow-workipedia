# Cardiovascular Stress Response Chronic Activation Disease

Noise >55 dB activates stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline) even during sleep → chronic exposure: hypertension +10-20%, heart attack +10-15%, stroke +5-10% → WHO: traffic noise causes 48,000 cases of heart disease annually in Europe → nighttime noise (>40 dB) most harmful (sleep disruption) → 30% of Europeans exposed to harmful night noise → aircraft noise near airports: +20-30% cardiovascular mortality → noise is second-leading environmental disease cause after air pollution.
