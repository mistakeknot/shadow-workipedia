# Carbonate Chemistry Saturation State Dissolution Threshold

Ocean absorption of 30% anthropogenic CO2 since 1750 follows deterministic equilibrium chemistry (CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 → 2H+ + CO32-) driving pH decline 8.2→8.1 (30% acidity increase) toward 7.8 by 2100 (150% increase), depleting carbonate ions needed for shell formation where saturation state Ω drops from >3.0 (supersaturated calcification possible) to <1.5 (stress threshold) to <1.0 (undersaturated dissolution), causing pteropod shells to dissolve 45% in 45 days at pH 7.8 in laboratory-confirmed irreversible chemistry.
