# Insurance Abandonment Property Value Collapse Spiral

Flood frequency increase → claims spike → premiums +30%/year → properties uninsured → values collapse → mortgage defaults → banks refuse lending → no buyers → abandonment → remaining residents cannot afford to leave → trapped populations → FEMA flood insurance claims spiking → government becomes insurer of last resort → unlimited liability (2-5 years once triggered, extremely difficult to reverse)
