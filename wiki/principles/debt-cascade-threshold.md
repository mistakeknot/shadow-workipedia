# Debt Cascade Threshold

Sovereign debt/GDP >90% creates self-reinforcing default probability acceleration where interest rates rise 2-5% per 10pt ratio increase, triggering currency weakness that raises import costs 15-30%, forcing austerity that contracts GDP 2-4% annually, reducing tax revenue 5-8% and pushing ratio higher, exemplified by Greece 2010-2015 (debt rose from 113% to 177% despite bailouts) and Argentina 2001 (187% peak before restructuring)
