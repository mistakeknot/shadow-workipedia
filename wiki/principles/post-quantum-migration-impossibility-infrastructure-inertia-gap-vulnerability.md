# Post Quantum Migration Impossibility Infrastructure Inertia Gap Vulnerability

Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization (NIST 2024) requires 10-20 year global migration (industrial control systems, embedded devices, legacy hardware) while quantum arrival estimated 2030-2035 creates 5-10 year gap where 60-80% infrastructure remains RSA-vulnerable during transition, as migration costs $500B-2T globally (chip replacement, software updates, testing, certification) and coordination impossibility across 195 nations with conflicting incentives ensures prolonged vulnerability window where quantum-capable adversaries exploit unupgraded systems.
