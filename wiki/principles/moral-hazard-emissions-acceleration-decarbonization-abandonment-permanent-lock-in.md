# Moral Hazard Emissions Acceleration Decarbonization Abandonment Permanent Lock In

SAI deployment reduces warming urgency causing fossil fuel emissions to continue 20-40% higher than counterfactual baseline, where political coalitions for renewable investment dissolve ("problem solved via geoengineering"), locking in 600-900 ppm CO₂ by 2100 (vs 450-550 ppm Paris pathways), creating permanent geoengineering dependency trap as stopping now commits to 3-4°C warming spike making termination politically impossible regardless of side effects, forcing perpetual deployment for centuries until ocean acidification or ozone depletion triggers civilization collapse.
