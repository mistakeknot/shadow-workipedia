# PASPA Repeal Legalization Cascade State Revenue Addiction

May 2018 Supreme Court struck PASPA → states legalize for tax revenue ($500M+/state projected) → 38 states legal by 2024 → $120B+ wagered 2023 (vs $5B 2018) → 1-3% problem gamblers in general population → sports bettors 2-3× higher problem rate → estimated 6-10M Americans with gambling disorder → state revenue depends on addiction: 50%+ from problem gamblers (per Australian research) → perverse incentive: states profit from mental health crisis.
