# Manufacturing Nationalism Geopolitical Competition Recovery

3 global vendors (ABB Switzerland, Siemens Germany, Hyundai South Korea) monopolize EHV transformer production 30 units/year → when Carrington-Class storm hits MULTIPLE nations simultaneously (solar CME affects entire dayside hemisphere) demand spikes 2,000-5,000 transformers globally vs 30/year supply → export bans (countries hoard domestic production), price gouging ($10M → $100M per unit), geopolitical leverage (USA/China/EU compete for manufacturing capacity, aid conditioned on transformer access), sabotage risk (adversaries target transformer shipments to delay rival recovery) → nations with domestic manufacturing (USA has zero EHV fabrication, imports 100%) face 30-50 year disadvantage vs nations with capacity (China/Germany/South Korea monopolize recovery) → investment in domestic transformer manufacturing ($50B, 10-year lead time to build facilities) politically impossible during normal times ("why subsidize obsolete heavy industry") but critical for sovereign resilience creating preparedness paradox where capability must exist BEFORE crisis but market incentives prevent development until TOO LATE (post-storm construction takes 10 years, by then civilization already collapsed).
