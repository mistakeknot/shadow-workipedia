# Gerrymandering Efficiency Gap Representation Distortion

National efficiency gap 7-8% R advantage (16 seats) → computer-optimized packing/cracking → Texas 34% D seats / 46-48% D votes → North Carolina 71.43% R seats / 50.7% R votes → redistricting cycle timing enables lock-in → court intervention limited post-Rucho → minority representation ratio distorted (one party votes wasted intentionally, democratic outcomes divorced from vote share, technology enables precision manipulation)
