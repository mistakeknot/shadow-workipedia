# Governance Token Plutocracy Treasury Capture

Governance tokens distributed to early users/investors → voting power concentrates (top 10 addresses often control >50% votes) → governance attacks: accumulate tokens → propose malicious upgrade → vote through → drain treasury → examples: Beanstalk ($182M, flash-loan governance attack), Build Finance ($470K, direct takeover) → defense requires time-locks (2-7 days) but creates upgrade friction → fundamental tension: decentralization vs security vs efficiency (pick two).
