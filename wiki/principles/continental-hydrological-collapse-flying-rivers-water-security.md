# Continental Hydrological Collapse Flying Rivers Water Security

Amazon evapotranspiration generates "flying rivers" (atmospheric moisture transport 20 billion tons/day eastward → southward via Andes deflection) providing 50-70% rainfall São Paulo/Lima/Bogotá regions creating urban water dependency where deforestation 25%+ reduces flying rivers 30-50% triggering urban water crises (São Paulo 21M people, Lima 10M, Bogotá 11M total 42M+ affected) forcing water rationing (4-8 hours/day supply, -40-60% industrial production, -30-50% GDP impacts affected cities) and hydropower collapse where Brazil 60% electricity hydropower-dependent, dry season reservoir levels drop critical (<30% capacity) producing energy rationing blackouts and agricultural cascade where rainfall-dependent farming (non-irrigated 70% Brazilian agriculture) suffers yield losses -30-60% creating food price spikes +40-100% triggering urban unrest and climate refugee migration where 5-20M internal displacement (rural → urban, drought regions → coast) overwhelms receiving cities producing favela expansion, violence, political instability demonstrating non-Amazon population dependence on Amazon rainfall where hydrological teleconnection means deforestation consequences extend 1,000-3,000 km beyond forest boundary affecting 100M-200M people who cannot vote Brazilian deforestation policy creating representation failure.
