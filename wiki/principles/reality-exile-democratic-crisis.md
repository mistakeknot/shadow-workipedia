# Reality Exile Democratic Crisis

Population disconnection from mainstream information sources escalates (5% → 10% → 20-30% by 2040-2050) driving alt-tech migration (Parler, Truth Social, Rumble, Telegram) and parallel epistemic communities with no shared factual foundation, triggering democratic legitimacy collapse (election acceptance 85% → 60% → 40% 2000-2040), political violence (armed protests, assassinations), and constitutional crisis (contested elections, dual governments) when reality exile exceeds 20% threshold.
