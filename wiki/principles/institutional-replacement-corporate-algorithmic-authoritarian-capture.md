# Institutional Replacement Corporate Algorithmic Authoritarian Capture

Declining institutions face replacement by corporate platforms (Google replacing libraries, YouTube replacing schools, LinkedIn replacing universities as credentialing), algorithmic systems (AI tutors, automated decision-making, predictive policing), or authoritarian control (state capture of education, media, civic organizations), where 50-70% populations prefer corporate/algorithmic alternatives to failed public institutions by 2035-2040 enabling wholesale institutional replacement that eliminates democratic accountability and collective governance transferring societal coordination from public deliberation to corporate/algorithmic/authoritarian control.
