# Transportation NIMBY Distributed Vulnerability Amplification

Moving 70,000+ tons accumulated waste to any repository requires 10,000+ shipments through populated areas where every community refuses routing (NIMBY), making transport politically impossible and forcing waste to remain distributed at 440 reactor sites increasing terrorism/sabotage vulnerability and ensuring pool degradation accidents, while Finland's Onkalo proves consent-based siting impossible (took 20 years for single low-population site, zero volunteers elsewhere despite $15B Yucca Mountain spent).
