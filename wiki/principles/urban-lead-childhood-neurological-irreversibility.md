# Urban Lead Childhood Neurological Irreversibility

24M homes with lead paint + lead service lines + leaded gasoline legacy in urban soil create concentrated childhood exposure pathways (paint dust, water, soil contact) driving blood lead levels >5 μg/dL threshold, causing permanent IQ point loss, developmental delays, ADHD/autism risk elevation, and behavioral effects (lead-crime hypothesis correlation) that persist across lifetimes with no reversal mechanism, systematically concentrated in poor/minority communities through environmental justice failures (historical industrial siting, political powerlessness preventing cleanup).
