# Semiconductor Fab Quantum Computer Production Bottleneck

Semiconductor 15-20% global consumption → single advanced fab 5,000-10,000 cubic feet/month → EUV lithography critical for next-gen chips → Taiwan 60% advanced chip helium demand → 2012 shortage some fabs reduced production 10-15% → quantum computers require helium-3 and helium-4 dilution refrigerators → helium-3 even rarer (nuclear weapons tritium decay primary source) → quantum computing deployment bottleneck (chip production + quantum = technology future dependent on finite resource)
