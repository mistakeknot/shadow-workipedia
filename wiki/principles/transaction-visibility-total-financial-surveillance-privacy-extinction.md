# Transaction Visibility Total Financial Surveillance Privacy Extinction

CBDC architecture enables complete transaction visibility where every payment (location, amount, merchant, timestamp) flows through central bank creating financial panopticon surpassing cash (anonymous), cards (aggregated data), or crypto (pseudonymous), as programmability enables real-time monitoring of suspicious patterns (large purchases, political donations, dissident funding) with 100% coverage vs current financial surveillance capturing 60-80% transactions, establishing privacy extinction where governments achieve perfect knowledge of citizen economic behavior enabling social credit scoring, algorithmic taxation, and preemptive financial restriction.
