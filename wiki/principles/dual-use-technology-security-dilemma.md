# Dual Use Technology Security Dilemma

Offensive cyber capabilities indistinguishable from defensive research (NSA EternalBlue exploit became WannaCry ransomware weapon via Shadow Brokers leak) → capability development requires zero-day stockpiling but vulnerabilities persist in own infrastructure → transparency impossible (revealing capabilities = losing advantage) but opacity looks aggressive → hardening one nation's infrastructure via offensive capability development threatens others creating security dilemma → international cooperation (UN GGE norms, Paris Call) requires 90% multilateral attribution consensus but individual nations lower threshold 60-80% for unilateral action → when treaty regime nations (EU 20% offensive budget) face aggressive offensive doctrines (USA/Russia 60-65% offensive) cooperation collapses as defensive measures interpreted as offensive preparation creating arms race dynamic where mutual vulnerability persists but trust erodes preventing coordinated defense.
