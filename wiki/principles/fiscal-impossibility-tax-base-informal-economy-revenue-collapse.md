# Fiscal Impossibility Tax Base Informal Economy Revenue Collapse

Megacity fiscal sustainability impossible as informal economy reaches 60-80% economic activity (sub-Saharan Africa 80%+, South Asia 70%+) evading taxation while formal tax base shrinks from capital flight and middle class exodus, where municipal revenues $50-200 per capita cannot fund required services $2,000-5,000 per capita creating permanent fiscal crisis, as property tax collection achieves only 20-40% assessed value (corruption, informal tenure, collection incapacity) and user fees politically unsustainable (water fee protests trigger riots) ensuring revenue sources exhausted while spending obligations grow creating debt trap or service abandonment binary outcomes.
