# GPS Constellation Destruction Cascading Infrastructure Collapse

Solar storm heats thermosphere 1200K → 2200K increasing atmospheric density 100-1000× at LEO altitudes → satellite drag force increases proportionally destroying 10-40% Starlink constellation (550 km), 5-15% OneWeb (1200 km) in 48 hours + radiation damage (solar proton fluence 10¹¹ protons/cm²) destroys 20% commercial satellites + degrades 60% → GPS signal degradation (ionospheric scintillation TEC 50 → 1000 TECU, accuracy 1m → 20m, timing error ±100ns → ±10ms) triggers cascades: aviation 15,000 flights/day grounded ($10B/day loss, -80% airspace capacity), shipping $50B/week trade disruption (automated cranes require GPS), agriculture -40% yield (precision farming GPS-dependent), military -70% effectiveness (GPS-guided munitions useless), financial markets frozen (HFT requires microsecond precision, $50T locked) creating single-point-of-failure vulnerability where modern civilization's space-based infrastructure simultaneously collapses from common-mode solar weather event.
