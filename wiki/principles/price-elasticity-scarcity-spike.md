# Price Elasticity Scarcity Spike

Water pricing exhibits exponential elasticity when scarcity exceeds 0.6 threshold with prices rising 100-1000x baseline, creating class-based access inequality where corporate extraction markup reaches 10,000x (Nestle bottled water) while municipal rationing exceeds 30 days triggering pool raid conflicts when disparity exceeds 5x.
