# Cultural Heritage Astronomical Extinction Meaning Loss

Humanity evolved under dark skies → night sky central to mythology, navigation, calendar, spirituality → light pollution eliminates: naked-eye astronomy (6000 stars → <100 visible), aurora viewing, meteor showers, zodiacal light → professional astronomy affected ($1B+ observatory relocations, space-based only solution) → astrotourism emerging ($5B+ industry) but destinations shrinking → children never experiencing darkness lose connection to cosmos → Bortle scale creep: Class 1 sites increasingly rare.
