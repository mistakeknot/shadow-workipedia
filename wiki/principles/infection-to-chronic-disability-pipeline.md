# Infection To Chronic Disability Pipeline

COVID infection converts to Long COVID at 10-20% rate (acute → chronic symptoms >3 months) with symptom distribution (brain fog 65%, fatigue 85%, POTS 30%, ME/CFS 15%) creating cumulative population burden (USA 2021-2024: 15-20M afflicted = 5-6% population) → reinfection probability amplification (+50% Long COVID risk, +30% severity per reinfection) drives permanent disability trap where 2-3 reinfections reduce recovery probability to <10% → labor force exits (2-4M workers = 1.2-2.5% of workforce) create economic drag ($50-100B GDP loss per 1% labor force reduction).
