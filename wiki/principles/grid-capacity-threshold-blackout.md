# Grid Capacity Threshold Blackout

Single hyperscale data center power demand (300MW-5GW approaching nuclear plant scale) exceeding 20% regional grid capacity triggers blackout risk forcing utility prioritization choice, where premium contracts incentivize AI over residential load creating political crisis (-0.30 legitimacy) when heat waves cause 3-7 day blackouts with 100-500 heat exposure casualties triggering riots and emergency moratoria.
