# Private Prison Lobbying Reform Capture Structural Barrier

Lobbying formula = revenue × 0.02-0.05 ($1.9B CoreCivic → $38-95M/year capability) → reform policies face -40% adoption penalty (abolition, sentencing reform blocked) → expansion policies receive +15% boost → per diem contracts $50-80/day with 90-100% occupancy guarantees → stock market linkage (population decline → CoreCivic -50% 2012-2016) → structural capture: legislators accepting donations cannot vote reform without losing funding (collective action problem) → requires court intervention (California PLATA 2011) or overwhelming movement (2020 BLM) to break.
