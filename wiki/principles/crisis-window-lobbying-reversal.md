# Crisis Window Lobbying Reversal

Crisis urgency (+45% max weight) + systemic risk (+35%) can override ideology entirely (NC 8%→63% strict regulation) for 3-6 months post-crisis, but finance lobbying $1.3B resistance (-52%) nearly blocks reform even then, and memory fade over 7-10 years (urgency +45%→0%) enables rollback (+$400M→+8% support) recreating pre-crisis conditions
