# Loss Ratio Death Spiral

Climate disasters drive insurance loss ratios (claims/premiums) from sustainable 1.05-1.15 baseline → catastrophic >1.50 (Florida 2022: 1.85) → insurer bankruptcy cascades (15+ Florida insurers 2022-2024, Hurricane Andrew 1992: 11 bankruptcies) → private market exodus from coastal/wildfire zones → government backstops (NFIP 5M policies, Florida Citizens +500% to 1.2M 2020-2024) absorb 100% risk creating irreversible market transformation.
