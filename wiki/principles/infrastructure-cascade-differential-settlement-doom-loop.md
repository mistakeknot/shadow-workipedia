# Infrastructure Cascade Differential Settlement Doom Loop

10cm difference across 100m ruptures gas mains + derails subway cars → water main breaks lose 40% supply (Mexico City) → pump harder to compensate → accelerates subsidence that broke pipes → 30% utility networks damaged + repair backlog >5 years = cascade threshold → repair costs exceed budget → deferred maintenance → more failures → business relocation → tax base erosion → less repair budget (self-reinforcing until physical limits)
