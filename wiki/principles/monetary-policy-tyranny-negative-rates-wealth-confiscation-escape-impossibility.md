# Monetary Policy Tyranny Negative Rates Wealth Confiscation Escape Impossibility

CBDC eliminates zero lower bound enabling unlimited negative interest rates as cash elimination prevents withdrawal to avoid wealth erosion (current -0.5% negative rates limited by cash hoarding), where central banks can impose -5% to -10% rates confiscating 50-100% savings over decade to force consumption and inflate away debt, combined with wealth taxes automatically deducted (2% annual wealth tax on all holdings programmatically enforced) creating monetary policy tyranny where savings impossible to protect and citizens powerless to resist confiscatory policies as all alternatives (cash, crypto, foreign assets) blocked through capital controls enforced at transaction protocol level.
