# Bridge Vulnerability Cross Chain Catastrophe Multiplier

Cross-chain bridges hold billions in locked assets → attack surface: smart contract bugs, validator compromise, oracle manipulation → bridge exploits 2022: Ronin $624M, Wormhole $326M, Nomad $190M, Harmony $100M → total bridge losses >$2B in single year → bridges are honeypots (concentrated value, complex code, multiple attack vectors) → no solution: bridges are necessary for multi-chain world but fundamentally insecure → bridges will remain primary attack target.
