# Exchange Counterparty Risk Concentration Cascade

Top 5 exchanges control 70-80% of spot volume (Binance 50%+, Coinbase 10%, others fragmenting) → exchange failure probability = f(reserve ratio, regulatory pressure, founder risk, hack exposure) → Mt. Gox (2014, $450M, 70% market share) → FTX (2022, $8B, 10% share) → next major failure probability 0.15-0.25/year → cascade mechanics: exchange failure → bank run on similar exchanges (24-72 hours) → forced selling → price crash 30-50% → margin calls → liquidation cascade → contagion to lending platforms (Celsius, BlockFi, Genesis pattern).
