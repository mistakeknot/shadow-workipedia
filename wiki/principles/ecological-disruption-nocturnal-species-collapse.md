# Ecological Disruption Nocturnal Species Collapse

30% of vertebrates, 60% of invertebrates are nocturnal → ALAN disrupts: migration (birds attracted to lit buildings, 600M-1B bird deaths/year US), reproduction (sea turtle hatchlings disoriented, 10-15% mortality), predation (moths to flames, bat foraging disrupted), pollination (80% of pollination is nocturnal) → insect decline (SW#79) accelerated by light traps → food web disruption from invertebrate base → coral spawning disrupted by moonlight mimicry → no species "adapts" to light pollution, only avoids lit areas.
