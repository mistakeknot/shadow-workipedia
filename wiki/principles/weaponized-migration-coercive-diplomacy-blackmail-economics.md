# Weaponized Migration Coercive Diplomacy Blackmail Economics

Migration flows as geopolitical leverage → EU-Turkey deal €6B 2016 to hold refugees → Belarus manufactured crisis 2021 (flew migrants, bused to Poland) → coercion spectrum (threat → demand → facilitation → manufactured crisis) → payment establishes precedent for future demands → deterrence spirals (border militarization, pushbacks illegal under EU law) → diplomatic cost vs. short-term relief trade-off
