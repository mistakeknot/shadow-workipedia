# Waste Export Global South Informal Sector Concentration

50%+ e-waste ends up in developing nations despite Basel Convention → Agbogbloshie Ghana 40,000+ informal workers → Guiyu China formerly world's largest (partially remediated) → regulatory arbitrage → warehouse fires in developing nations underreported, minimal hazmat response → rich nations lack capacity → export to less regulated nations → risk concentrates in most vulnerable places (waste exports don't eliminate risk, just relocate to places with least capacity to respond)
