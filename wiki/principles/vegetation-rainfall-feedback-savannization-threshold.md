# Vegetation Rainfall Feedback Savannization Threshold

Amazon trees evapotranspire 50-80% rainfall recycled into atmosphere creating forest-atmosphere coupling where deforestation reduces rainfall with impact curve 0-10% deforestation → 1-3% rainfall reduction (minimal), 10-20% → 3-10% reduction (moderate), 20-25% → 10-20% reduction (accelerating), 25%+ → 20-40%+ reduction (runaway collapse threshold crossed) and each 1% rainfall loss lengthens dry season +2-4 days until dry season >4 months triggers year-round fire risk with rainfall <1500mm/year preventing forest regeneration enabling grassland dominance (savanna conversion) producing carbon flip dynamics where forest sink (2 GtCO₂/year absorbed 1970-2010) transforms to source (1-5 GtCO₂/year emitted fires + decomposition post-dieback) destroying Paris climate goals and creating irreversibility where historical calibration shows 1970 10% deforestation baseline → 2000 15% -5% rainfall → 2019 17% -8% rainfall 76,000 mega-fires August → 2025 20% -12% rainfall extended dry season approaching 25% tipping point where vegetation-rainfall positive feedback becomes self-sustaining independent of human deforestation enabling runaway transformation.
