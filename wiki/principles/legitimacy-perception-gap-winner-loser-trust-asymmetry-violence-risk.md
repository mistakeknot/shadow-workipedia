# Legitimacy Perception Gap Winner Loser Trust Asymmetry Violence Risk

Election trust varies by winner/loser (+15% winner boost, -10-25% loser penalty) → elite signaling amplifies loser distrust → partisan gap widens → effective voting rights index (EVRI) declines → legitimacy crisis risk increases → violence trigger risk feeds SW#106 political violence → democratic backsliding indicators (trust in elections becomes tribal, legitimacy conditional on winning, spiral toward violence, democratic norms erode)
