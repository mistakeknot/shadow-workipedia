# Mass Shooting Normalization Policy Gridlock Desensitization

Mass shootings 269 (2014) → 656 (2023, 1.6/day) → school shootings 82 with casualties (2023) → Uvalde massacre (21 dead) + zero federal response → public desensitization threshold crossed → learned helplessness → active shooter drills kindergarten-normalization → forgetting cycle (outrage → NRA mobilization → legislative failure → repeat) (normalization as policy outcome, massacre becomes unremarkable, child death accepted cost, gridlock breeds despair)
