# Coordination Cascade Participation Threshold

General strikes require coordination threshold where millions must walk out simultaneously despite individual risk → base participation rate 5-67% workforce (Seattle 1919 12%, UK 1926 17%, France 1968 67%) determined by grievance level (0.70-0.90 = 20% participation, >0.90 = 40-67%), union density >20-40% enabling coordination, strike fund capacity $1M-100M sustaining walkout → catalyzing events (massacre, betrayal, economic collapse) create 15× probability multiplier creating tipping point where participation cascades via solidarity strikes (miners walkout → transport sympathy → general strike) or fizzles when threshold unmet creating all-or-nothing dynamic where successful strikes require 95%+ militant sectors participating to trigger cascade but 20-40% overall participation breaks state/capital negotiating position.
