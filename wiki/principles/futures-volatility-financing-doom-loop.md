# Futures Volatility Financing Doom Loop

Water futures speculation escalates from 20-30% market share (CME 2020-2023 baseline) → 40-60% (2023-2030 expansion) → 60-80% (2030-2050 maturity, oil/gold precedent), amplifying volatility from regulated +10-20% → speculative +30-80%, triggering margin call cascades (10:1 to 20:1 leverage) that crash prices 50-70%, making desal contracts uneconomical (revenue <costs), raising financing from 4-6% debt → 8-12% distressed, halting construction and creating scarcity-speculation vicious cycle.
