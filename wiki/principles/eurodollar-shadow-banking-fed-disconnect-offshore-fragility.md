# Eurodollar Shadow Banking Fed Disconnect Offshore Fragility

$13T+ in offshore dollar liabilities (eurodollars) exist outside Fed supervision → dollar funding provided by non-US banks, money market funds, shadow banking → Fed cannot directly inject liquidity to offshore system → 2008/2020 crises required emergency swap lines ($450B+) to prevent collapse → swap line access is geopolitical: allies get dollars, adversaries don't → emerging markets without swap access face dollar shortages, forced default, currency crisis → eurodollar system is plumbing of global trade, invisible until it breaks.
