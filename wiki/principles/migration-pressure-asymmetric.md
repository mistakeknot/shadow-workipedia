# Migration Pressure Asymmetric

Economic collapse, violence, and climate stress create massive migration flows that primarily burden neighboring states and the US, creating cascading political crises across multiple countries—measured by outmigration rate (Venezuela 25% of population fled), transit country strain (Mexico processing 3M+ annually), and US border encounter volumes (2.4M FY2023).
