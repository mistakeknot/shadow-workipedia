# Expert Authority Collapse Conspiracy Proliferation Epistemological Crisis

Expert authority evaporates as public trust in scientists/doctors/academics falls below 40% (vs 70% historical) enabling conspiracy theory proliferation where 30-50% populations believe vaccines dangerous, climate change hoax, elections rigged, creating epistemological crisis where no shared factual foundation exists for policy debate, and alternative expert networks (podcasters, influencers, religious authorities achieving 60-80% trust among adherents vs 20-30% institutional experts) replace credentialed authorities establishing post-institutional knowledge production where truth claims determined by tribal affiliation not empirical evidence.
