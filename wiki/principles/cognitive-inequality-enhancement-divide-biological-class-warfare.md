# Cognitive Inequality Enhancement Divide Biological Class Warfare

Neural enhancement creates cognitive stratification where BCI users achieve IQ gains +5 (working memory), +10 (processing speed), +20 (long-term augmentation) translating to income differential 1.5× (5-year users), 2.0× (10-year), 2.5× (20-year) and wealth accumulation 14.5× over 30-year career (compound returns on cognitive advantage), establishing biological class division where enhanced elite (10% population 2040) capture 60-80% economic gains while unenhanced majority faces permanent competitive disadvantage, triggering either coercive enhancement mandates (workplace discrimination, educational requirements) or violent backlash as cognitive inequality becomes hereditary through enhancement access correlating with parental wealth.
