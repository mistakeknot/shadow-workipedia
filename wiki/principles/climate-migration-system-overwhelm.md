# Climate Migration System Overwhelm

Central America droughts + hurricanes + crop failures drive border encounters surge (1M 2019 → 2.5M 2023 → 5M+ projected 2030s) → detention capacity exhaustion (34k design vs 52k+ demand creates permanent overflow) → court backlog explosion (1M+ cases, 5-year wait times) → asylum processing breakdown → political pressure for mass deportation peaks → deportation cost explosion ($12,500 per person × 400k/year = $5B-$10B annually) creates fiscal unsustainability → when climate migration exceeds 3M/year AND detention/court capacity maxed the system collapses forcing choice between amnesty (political suicide for enforcement advocates) or permanent limbo (economic/humanitarian disaster).
