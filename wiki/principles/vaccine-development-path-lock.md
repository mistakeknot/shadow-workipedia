# Vaccine Development Path Lock

12-18 month development timeline creates temporal mismatch with exponential disease phase, forcing countries into high-mortality window where early vaccination uptake <40% generates immune escape mutations at R=3+ transmission rates, creating 3-5 year pandemic duration vs 2-year natural resolution for fully susceptible populations.
