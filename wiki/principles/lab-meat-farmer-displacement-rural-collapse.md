# Lab Meat Farmer Displacement Rural Collapse

Cost trajectory $325k→$17/lb (2013→2023) → price parity $3/lb target 2030 → livestock farming collapse S-curve → rural community 1:7 job multiplier economic death → farmer suicide clusters (calibrate to 1980s farm crisis 900/year peak) → political backlash culture war + state bans (2 enacted) + rewilding vs. solar land conversion (technology disruption faster than adaptation)
