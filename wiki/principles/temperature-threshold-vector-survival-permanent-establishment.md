# Temperature Threshold Vector Survival Permanent Establishment

Climate warming crosses vector survival thresholds enabling permanent establishment where winter minimums rise above 10°C (Aedes mosquitoes) or -5°C (Ixodes ticks), dengue explodes from 9 countries (1970) to 129 countries (2024), Aedes aegypti established in 28 US states (2 in 1995), blacklegged tick 46% northward expansion (1996-2019), altitude gain 100m per 0.6°C warming brings malaria to 2,000m East Africa, creating endemic disease burden in previously safe temperate zones.
