# Qualified Immunity Impunity Cycle

Qualified immunity doctrine (1967 Pierson v. Ray) creates "clearly established" catch-22 where courts require prior case with nearly identical facts but grant immunity before creating precedent → 50-70% civil rights lawsuits dismissed before trial → criminal prosecution rarity (<1% of 1,000 police killings/year charged, <0.1% convicted: 10-20 charged, 1-2 convicted annually) → officers personally immune while cities pay settlements $300M-$500M/year (George Floyd $27M, Eric Garner $5.9M) → financial shield + police union contracts (48-72 hour delay before questioning, erase misconduct records after 2-5 years, arbitration overturns firings) → structural impunity.
