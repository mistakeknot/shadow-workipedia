# Immune Escape Mutation Dynamics

Mutation rate × transmission intensity creates immune evasion where vaccine effectiveness declines 25-35% per major variant emergence, requiring continuous vaccine updates that lag variant emergence by 4-6 months, generating perpetual pandemic state in low-vaccination populations (historical precedent: 2-year Spanish Flu W-shaped mortality curve with secondary wave 20% deadlier).
