# Virality Asymmetry Truth Decay

False information spreads 6× faster than truth via memetic virality mechanics (emotional valence +outrage/fear boost 2-6×, shares per exposure 0.001-0.10), while AI-generated content quality progression (visual deepfakes 0.30 → 0.98, audio clones 0.20 → 0.95, text 0.40 → 0.90 by 2040) and production cost collapse ($1,000s → $0.01 per piece by 2030) create exponential disinformation supply overwhelming linear fact-checking capacity (5-20 checks/day/org vs millions of viral posts).
