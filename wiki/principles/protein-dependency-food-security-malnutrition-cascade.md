# Protein Dependency Food Security Malnutrition Cascade

200M+ people globally depend on freshwater fish as primary affordable protein (Mekong 60M at 80%, Congo 40M, Amazon 20M), collapse eliminates protein access for populations without marine alternatives (inland distances, costs, infrastructure), triggering malnutrition cascade where 50M children face stunting/cognitive damage, subsistence economies dissolve, migration to urban slums accelerates as oldest human protein source disappears.
