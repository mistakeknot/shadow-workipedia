# Wildlife Communication Masking Behavioral Disruption

Anthropogenic noise masks animal communication → birds: sing louder, higher pitch, night shifting (but higher predation at night) → marine mammals: shipping noise interferes with whale song across ocean basins → mating calls, territorial warnings, parent-offspring communication disrupted → behavioral displacement: species avoid noisy areas, habitat effectively lost → stress responses: cortisol elevation in wildlife near highways, airports → acoustic ecology: soundscapes as ecosystems with "acoustic niches."
