# Reshoring Impossibility Expertise Extinction Dependency Lock

Fifty years offshoring creates irreversible capacity loss where expertise extinct (US hasn't made consumer electronics since 1990s), capital requirements prohibitive ($20B chip fab, $1B auto plant, 2-3 year construction), workforce gaps (engineers/technicians moved overseas), component ecosystem dependencies (need 1000s suppliers, all offshore), cost reality (labor 10-20× domestic vs offshore) ensures reshoring economically unviable making geographic concentration permanent vulnerability.
