# Fentanyl Economics Cartel Adaptation Analog Arms Race

Chinese precursor supply + Mexican cartel adaptation → fentanyl 50× morphine potency, 1/100 volume → manufacturing economics irresistible → illicit fentanyl floods market → nitazene emergence when fentanyl scheduled → molecular modification outpaces regulation → analog scheduling futility (economic logic drives synthetic dominance, regulatory whack-a-mole impossible, each ban creates more potent successor)
