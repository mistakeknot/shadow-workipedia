# Toxic Plume Mass Casualty HF Generation

Hydrogen fluoride (HF) generation 20-200 mg/Wh of battery burned → lethal concentration 30 ppm for 10 minutes → heavy metal particulates (cobalt, nickel, manganese, lithium) → evacuation zones 1-10+ km → 100,000+ battery warehouse ignites → toxic plume over major city → mass evacuation → hundreds of casualties → cleanup costs $10-100M+ per major incident → Agbogbloshie cancer clusters from informal e-waste burning (concentrated storage creates catastrophic risk, toxic plume potential = mass casualty event)
