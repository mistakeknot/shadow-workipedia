# Autonomous Propagation Irreversibility Threshold

Gene drive inheritance bias 95-99% offspring carry modification (vs 50% Mendelian natural inheritance) combined with species generation time (mosquitoes 30 days, rodents 60 days, fish 180 days) produces geographic diffusion initial release site → 100km radius years 2-3 → regional spread 500km years 5-7 → continental/hemispheric spread 3,000km+ years 7-10 where population replacement dynamics follow wild-type → modified → resistant fractions over 20-50 generations with irreversibility threshold >5% modified + <10% resistant alleles = runaway hemispheric spread in 5-10 years and resistance emergence 1-5% per generation mutation rate creates drive-resistant alleles via selection pressure but horizontal gene transfer risk 0.01-0.1% probability drive cassette jumps to related species via viral vectors or bacterial conjugation enables cross-species contamination where Florida Keys 2021 release 750M modified Aedes aegypti mosquitoes detected resistance within 18 months demonstrating underestimated mutation rate (3% actual vs 1% expected) and if >5% population modified spreads Caribbean year 3 → Central America year 5 → South America year 7-10 creating permanent ecosystem modification where even if gene drive reversed (resistant population reintroduced) ecosystem doesn't recover due to species extinctions and food web rewiring requiring 30-100 year timescales demonstrating commitment irreversibility where decade-scale decision locks century-scale consequences.
