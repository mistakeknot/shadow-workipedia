# Precipitation Enhancement Seeding Rain Bomb Flash Flood Cascade

Seeding pyroCb-generated clouds with 250 kg silver iodide achieves +25% precipitation enhancement (80 mm natural → 100 mm total over 8 hours) where 40 mm excess rainfall across Yangtze watershed increases peak discharge from 55,000 m³/s to 75,000 m³/s forcing emergency Three Gorges spillway opening flooding 15,000 buildings downstream with insufficient warning time causing 180 deaths and $8B infrastructure damage, demonstrating weaponized weather modification turning natural storms into precision flood weapons.
