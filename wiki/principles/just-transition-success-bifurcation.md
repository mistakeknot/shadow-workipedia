# Just Transition Success Bifurcation

Retraining funding $5k-20k/worker creates 40% re-employment success within 2 years when combined with local economic diversification (Houston petrochemical cluster), but <15% success without funding or in isolated regions (rural North Dakota), where failure path generates worker radicalization → sabotage escalation → climate policy backlash that delays transition and worsens eventual collapse
