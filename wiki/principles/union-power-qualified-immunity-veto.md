# Union Power Qualified Immunity Veto

Police union binding arbitration 72% large cities → 98% complaint dismissal rate when unions strong vs 50% when weak, creating accountability vacuum where qualified immunity becomes untouchable (only 4 states pass reform vs 35 attempt) despite 89% bill defeat rate, making reform politically impossible without federal intervention (gridlock)
