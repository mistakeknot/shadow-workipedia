# Blasphemy Ratchet Irreversibility

Once blasphemy laws enacted (activates at Favored Majority regime+), prosecution rate = fundamentalism × 5% per million with mob violence preceding trial at 30% vigilante rate (Pakistan 1,500+ cases 1986-2025 → 75+ mob killings), creating ratchet mechanism where repealing law becomes politically suicidal (perceived as "blasphemous" → death threats) and enforcement intensifies permanently, exemplified by Pakistan Zia-ul-Haq 1986 law → politicians proposing repeal assassinated (Taseer 2011, Bhatti 2011) → law untouchable, making conviction <1% + acquittal rate 0% by 2020 irreversible without regime change or international military intervention
