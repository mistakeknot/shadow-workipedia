# Unilateral Deployment Capability Sovereignty Bypass Treaty Impossibility

100-200 aircraft spraying sulfate aerosols at 18-25 km altitude costs $2-10B/year making stratospheric aerosol injection feasible for 20+ nations or billionaires bypassing international consensus (ENMOD treaty has 78 parties but zero enforcement precedents), creating ungovernable proliferation where technical barriers (high-altitude aircraft modified Gulfstream G550 range or military tankers) fall 2030-2050 as commercial platforms emerge, ensuring geoengineering becomes inevitable first-mover race rather than negotiated framework.
