# Coordinated Default Negotiating Leverage

Individual nation default creates pariah status + capital market exclusion with minimal negotiating power → 20-50 countries coordinating payment suspension simultaneously (post-hurricane season) creates collective leverage → debt service suspension $50-200B halted forces IMF/Paris Club emergency negotiations → creditor panic drives debt-for-climate swap concessions vs chaotic default wave → managed default via Paris Club restructuring becomes preferable to unilateral suspension → coordination threshold where 30-50% climate-vulnerable nations acting together can reshape international finance architecture vs fragmented individual defaults achieving minimal relief.
