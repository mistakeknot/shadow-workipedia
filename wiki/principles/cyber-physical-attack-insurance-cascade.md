# Cyber Physical Attack Insurance Cascade

SCADA system vulnerabilities (40% utilities lack adequate defenses) combined with physical substation attacks (Metcalf 2013: 17 transformers shot nearly blacked out 1M+ people) create copycat amplification when successful attacks causing >3 major blackouts/year trigger insurance market withdrawal (grid infrastructure "uninsurable"), preventing utilities from financing security upgrades ($10B+ shortfall) or repairs without coverage, accelerating microgrid defection and utility bankruptcy waves.
