# Organic Matter Yield Collapse Threshold

Soil organic matter declines 3-6% (1900s baseline)→1-2% (2020s degraded) at 2-5%/decade depletion rate (tillage oxidation, monoculture, chemical soil biology kill 0-90%) vs 0.1-0.5%/year regeneration (cover crops, no-till), with yield plateau at <2% organic matter, decline beginning <1.5%, and catastrophic productivity loss <1% reached 2040-2060 despite fertilizer dependency escalating +300% since 1960s for stagnant yields.
