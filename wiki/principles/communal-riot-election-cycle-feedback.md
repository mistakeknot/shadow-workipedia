# Communal Riot Election Cycle Feedback

Regime = Favored Majority + elections imminent triggers periodic communal riots (45%/year probability, 100-2,000 dead) timed deliberately to polarize electorate, creating election victory feedback loop where violence benefits ruling majority party through polarization (India 1992 Babri Masjid 2,000 dead → BJP gains, 2002 Gujarat 1,000+ dead → BJP landslide, 2020 Delhi 53 dead → BJP municipal win), incentivizing regime to allow police complicity and judicial non-prosecution, making democratic reversal impossible when majority party controls elections and benefits from violence normalization, self-reinforcing through two cycles (~20 years) until violence becomes structural feature permanent unless external shock (international intervention, revolution) breaks cycle
