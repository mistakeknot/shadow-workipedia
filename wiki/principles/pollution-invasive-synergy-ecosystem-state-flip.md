# Pollution Invasive Synergy Ecosystem State Flip

Multi-source pollution (agriculture, industrial, urban, mining) creates degraded baseline giving invasive species decisive advantage in contaminated environments, Lake Victoria Nile perch introduction extinguished 200+ endemic cichlids (500→300 survivors), Mississippi Asian carp now 90% fish biomass, eutrophication death spirals (algae blooms→oxygen depletion→native mortality→invasive dominance) flipping ecosystems to degraded monocultures impossible to reverse.
