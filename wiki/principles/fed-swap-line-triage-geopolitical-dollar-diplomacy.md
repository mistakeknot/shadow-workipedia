# Fed Swap Line Triage Geopolitical Dollar Diplomacy

Fed swap lines ($unlimited to 5 central banks: ECB, BoE, BoJ, SNB, BoC) vs ($60B temporary to 9 others in 2020) vs (nothing to 180+ countries) → crisis triage: who gets dollars, who defaults → swap line access correlates with alliance status, not economic need → BRICS+ countries (40% world GDP) lack permanent access → creates pressure for alternative reserve currency → but Fed cannot extend to everyone (moral hazard, unlimited liability) → structural dollar shortage for non-aligned.
