# Treaty Enforcement Vacuum Verification Impossibility CRQC Opacity

Quantum computing arms control verification faces fundamental impossibility as CRQC distinguishes from classical quantum computers only by qubit count (4,000+ logical vs <1,000 current) and error rates (<10^-3 vs >10^-2) with no external observable signature, where dual-use commercial quantum research (optimization, drug discovery, climate modeling) provides perfect cover for weapons development and physical inspection cannot determine cryptographic capability without running Shor's algorithm test (reveals possession), creating verification vacuum where CRQC proliferation ungovernable and treaty compliance unenforceable.
