# Intensity Radicalization Ladder Violence Threshold

Intensity scale 0.0-1.0 maps to radicalization: 0.0-0.3 cultural preference, 0.3-0.5 political mobilization, 0.5-0.7 vigilante activism, 0.7-1.0 genocidal intent → vigilante formation threshold: prevalence >0.50 + intensity >0.40 → Gau Rakshaks form (10k-100k members, police complicity 0.50-0.70) → massacre monthly probability = intensity × impunity × 0.01 → Gujarat 2002: 0.60 × 0.70 = 0.42% monthly realized (1,000-2,000 killed).
