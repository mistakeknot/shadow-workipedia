# Asymmetry Amplification One Sided Justice

Landlords and debt collectors appear with attorneys 90%+ of the time; tenants and debtors have counsel <10%. Algorithmic systems designed by plaintiffs' bar encode creditor-favorable presumptions. Default judgment rates approach 70%+ because defendants lack capacity to contest—algorithms make this faster, not fairer.
