# Boom Bust Cyclicality Four Year Halving Correlation

Bitcoin halving events (2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, 2028...) reduce mining rewards 50% → supply shock triggers speculative mania 12-18 months post-halving → peak bubble (2013: $1.1k, 2017: $19k, 2021: $69k, 2025: $150-250k projected) → 80-85% crash over 12-18 months → accumulation floor → repeat cycle → each cycle 10x previous peak but diminishing returns (2029: 3-5x vs 10x historical) → cycle amplitude dampens as market cap grows ($3T+ stabilizes volatility to ±50% vs ±90% early cycles).
