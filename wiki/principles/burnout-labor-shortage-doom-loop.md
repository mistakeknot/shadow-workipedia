# Burnout Labor Shortage Doom Loop

Healthcare sector 62% burnout drives 18-73% attrition depending on sector, increasing patient ratios (1:10→1:15 nurses) and overwork +30-70% on remaining staff, creating reinforcing spiral where burnout >70% in 3+ major sectors triggers mass exodus (>30%/year healthcare worker attrition vs 15% sustainable) collapsing essential services.
