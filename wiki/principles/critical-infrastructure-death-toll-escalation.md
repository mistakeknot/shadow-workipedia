# Critical Infrastructure Death Toll Escalation

Hospitals targeted preferentially (60-70% payment rate vs 30-40% government due to lives at stake) → 560+ healthcare ransomware attacks 2016-2022 US → patients die during lockouts (documented: German woman 2020 ambulance diverted, Alabama newborn 2019 fetal monitoring down → brain damage) → Johns Hopkins model estimates 5-20 excess deaths per hospital attack (surgery delays, ambulance diversions, misdiagnoses) → projected 5,600+ ransomware deaths 2016-2022 (560 attacks × 10 avg deaths) → political pressure for payment ban but organizations refuse creates systems-down-for-months scenario (Scripps $113M loss 4 weeks, Ireland HSE 6 months $600M) → impossible choice between funding terrorism vs patient deaths.
