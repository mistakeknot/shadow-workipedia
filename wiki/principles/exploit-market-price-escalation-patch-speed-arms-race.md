# Exploit Market Price Escalation Patch Speed Arms Race

Zero-day vulnerability discovery rate 50-100 mobile OS annually with 30% researcher sales to brokers (vs responsible disclosure) drives pricing dynamics iOS exploits $500K (2015) → $2.5M (2019) → $5M (2025) 5-year doubling, Android $100K-$1M, Windows $500K-$2M as patch speed improvement iOS 120 days (2015) → 30 days (2025), Android 180 → 60 days, Windows 90 → 45 days reduces exploit lifespan 312 days average (2015) → 120 days (2025) with detection probability 15% → 40% (Apple Lockdown Mode 90% zero-click blocks, Citizen Lab network forensics 40% detection) creating burn cost externality where vendors deploy recklessly (moral hazard customers bear $500K-$5M exploit loss) and exploit complexity escalation requires 3-5 chained vulnerabilities (2015) vs 7-10 vulnerabilities (2025) development cost $500K → $2M per chain driving vendor counter-adaptation hardware implants $500K-$2M per target (vs $50K software), supply chain interdiction (device interception transit), social engineering (phishing) when software exploits become economically unviable creating permanent escalation where device makers improve defenses → vendors increase sophistication → costs rise 10× → only high-value targets economically viable (heads of state, opposition leaders) but authoritarian regimes still deploy against 100-10,000 individuals (journalists, dissidents, diaspora) accepting $50M-$500M annual surveillance budgets.
