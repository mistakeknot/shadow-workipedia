# Exemption Clustering School Level Pockets Outbreak Incubation

State exemption rates 3% average mask 30-50% school-level clusters → personal belief exemptions available 15 states → geographic concentration (Briscoe County TX 20%, Childress 29.5%) → outbreak epicenters in low-coverage pockets → Disneyland 2014 → California SB277 eliminates personal exemptions 2015 (school-level clustering creates herd immunity holes, state averages hide vulnerability, outbreak triggers policy response with 1-2 year lag)
