# DNA Exoneration Innocence Shock Cascade

DNA technology capability curve (0.10 detection in 1989 → 1.0 perfect reliability 2020s) enables wrongful conviction detection revealing 4% death row population innocent (200+ cumulative exonerations) → media coverage feedback loop (each exoneration → +$2M-$5M investigation funding → more exonerations discovered) → public opinion erosion (80% support 1990s → 54% 2020s, exoneration events -10% to -15% support shock) → abolition momentum (Illinois moratorium 2000-2003, New Jersey abolishes 2007) despite victim family opposition creating political tension.
