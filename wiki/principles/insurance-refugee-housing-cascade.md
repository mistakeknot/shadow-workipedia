# Insurance Refugee Housing Cascade

Insurer exodus + property value collapse (-30-70% overnight when mortgage lenders foreclose on uninsured properties) triggers coastal/wildfire zone population displacement (Florida 2M-5M, California 1M-3M projected 2025-2040) → inland "climate haven" cities (Great Lakes, Pacific Northwest) experience sudden demand surge (+10-50% in 1-3 years) → housing prices spike +30-70% → median price-to-income ratio escalates from manageable 10× → crisis 15-20× → locals experience secondary displacement → political backlash drives anti-growth NIMBY policies → supply constrained → prices escalate further in compounding cascade.
