# Cross Bloc Communication Collapse

Global internet users able to communicate via common protocols declines from 95% baseline (2020) → 70-80% early splinternet (2023-2030) → 40-60% mid splinternet (2030-2045) → <20% hard splinternet (2045-2060) as DNS splits, SSL certificate authority regionalization, and messaging protocol incompatibility fragment connectivity requiring underground mesh networks for cross-bloc access.
