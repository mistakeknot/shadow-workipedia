# Fungal Thermotolerance Thermal Exclusion Breakdown Mammalian Vulnerability

65-million-year thermal exclusion barrier (mammals 37°C body temp prevents fungal infection) collapsing as Candida auris evolves 37°C+ growth capability, agricultural fungicide use (25% global deployment) drives pan-resistant strains (4% resistant to all antifungal classes), 30-60% mortality rates, hospital environmental persistence (4 weeks on surfaces), demonstrating evolutionary adaptation where climate warming + antifungal selection pressure creates previously impossible human-fungal pathogen emergence.
