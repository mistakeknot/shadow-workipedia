# Recidivism Reentry Barrier Trap

Incarceration creates compounding reentry barriers (employment rejection 60-80% with criminal record checkbox, public housing bans since 1996, driver's license suspension in 11 states, federal student aid ban 1994-2020, voting restrictions in 48 states for 4.6M citizens) → homelessness + unemployment → re-arrest probability 68% at 3 years, 77% at 5 years, 83% at 9 years (DOJ 401k prisoner study 2014) → parole technical violations (not new crimes) return 40% of parolees → revolving door perpetuates despite rehabilitation program effectiveness (-43% recidivism for education) being undermined by funding constraints ($1-4k per prisoner, 5-10% total costs, only 35% access).
