# Port Relocation Cascade Stranded Asset Crisis

Sea level rise +1m → +2m → +3m triggers port vulnerability thresholds where 50% port area flooded = relocation trigger forcing major cities (Shanghai, Rotterdam, LA, NYC, Singapore top 5 risk) choose seawall economics ($60B NYC proposal, $100B+ Shanghai with 5-10% capex annual maintenance, effectiveness limits >4-5m rise storm surge combination fails) vs inland relocation ($200B-500B per megahub 100km inland, 15-25 year construction timeline) creating stranded asset losses $5-10T globally (coastal real estate, port infrastructure, utilities) and shipping route recalculation where new inland port network increases shipping distances 2-5 days major routes raising logistics costs 10-25% imposing global trade GDP impact -1 to -3% and insurance withdrawal where Lloyd's voids coastal property policies (precedent Florida 2020s) triggering mortgage crisis (banks won't lend uninsurable zones) producing property value collapse -60 to -90% creating sovereign debt crisis for coastal nations (port revenues -30-50%, tourism collapse, fiscal space evaporates) forcing choice between $1-5T adaptation spending (seawalls/relocation) now vs certain economic collapse later but present prosperity politically mandates delay until crisis manifest enabling catastrophic unpreparedness.
