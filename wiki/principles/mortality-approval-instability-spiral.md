# Mortality Approval Instability Spiral

Excess mortality >2% population generates approval penalties (-15 points per 1M deaths) that destabilize governments when death toll reaches 0.5-2% during rapid growth phase, creating political paralysis that prevents timely response measures (lockdowns, healthcare mobilization, vaccine prioritization), extending mortality by estimated 30-50% relative to coordinated response scenarios.
