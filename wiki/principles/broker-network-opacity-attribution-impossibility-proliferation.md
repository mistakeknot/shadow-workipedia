# Broker Network Opacity Attribution Impossibility Proliferation

Exploit broker networks Zerodium/Crowdfence/Vupen public pricing 30% deals disclosed vs gray-market brokers 5% transparency operate from multiple jurisdictions simultaneously (Candiru shell companies 5 countries, NSO Group Cyprus/Luxembourg structures) with buyer vetting 'strict' → 'moderate' → 'none' progression as market fragments creating attribution impossibility where zero-day deployed against target (Pegasus infection detected Citizen Lab forensics) cannot trace broker → vendor → client chain when 2-5× markups at each layer (researcher $1M → broker $2M → vendor $5M → client $15M) and cryptocurrency payments (mixing, privacy coins) break financial trails enabling plausible deniability where spyware vendors claim "lawful intercept only" while selling to authoritarian regimes (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Morocco, Egypt) that target journalists/activists creating legal shield where vendors operate democracies (Israel, US, Europe) arguing counterterrorism legitimacy while 80-90% deployments target civil society (Pegasus 50,000 targets: journalists 180, activists 600, opposition politicians 85, business executives 65, heads of state 14, terrorists <10 based on Forbidden Stories investigation) and market opacity where broker proliferation post-bankruptcy (FinFisher → 3 successors, NSO bankruptcy risk → employee spinoffs anticipated) reduces pricing transparency from 30% → 5% making market analysis impossible for export control enforcement creating permanent information asymmetry where regulators cannot track sales volumes/destinations/pricing defeating Wassenaar reporting requirements enabling surveillance proliferation undetected.
