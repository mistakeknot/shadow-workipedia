# Irreversibility Timescale Mismatch Committed Warming Refreezing Impossibility

Once permafrost thaws, refreezing requires 10,000+ years even under cooling conditions (thermal inertia + groundwater flow prevents refreeze), making any carbon release effectively permanent on civilization timescales—after Yedoma reaches 20% thawed (100-200 Gt of 500-1,000 Gt mobilized), thermal decomposition heat + landscape fragmentation + hydrological activation create irreversible cascade, locking in 0.5-1.5°C additional global warming even if all anthropogenic emissions stopped immediately, demonstrating fundamental asymmetry where decades of emissions commit millennia of consequences.
