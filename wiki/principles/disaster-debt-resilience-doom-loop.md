# Disaster Debt Resilience Doom Loop

Climate disasters impose GDP losses (hurricanes -5% to -20%, floods -2% to -10%, droughts -3% to -15%) requiring reconstruction borrowing at 1.5-3× initial damage → cumulative debt accumulation drives debt service >40-60% revenue creating unsustainability threshold → resilience investment needs ($50-200B annually) crowded out by debt payments → underspending drives +50% future disaster severity via infrastructure degradation → worsening disasters require more borrowing in compounding cascade → when cumulative disaster costs exceed 50-100% GDP over 5-10 years resilience investment becomes impossible creating permanent vulnerability trap.
