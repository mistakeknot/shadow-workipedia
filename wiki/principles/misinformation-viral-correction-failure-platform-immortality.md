# Misinformation Viral Correction Failure Platform Immortality

Anti-vaccine content spreads 6× faster than corrections → platform algorithms amplify emotionally charged content → Wakefield "Vaxxed" 2016 documentary 2M+ views → cross-platform migration (YouTube → Facebook → Telegram → Gab) → celebrity/influencer effects (Jenny McCarthy, RFK Jr) → fact-checks backfire for committed skeptics (information environment favors misinformation, correction infrastructure inadequate, content persists indefinitely on alternative platforms, trust cannot be rebuilt at scale)
