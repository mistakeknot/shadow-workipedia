# Remote Work Vacancy Valuation Cascade

Remote/hybrid work penetration 50-80% drives office demand collapse -30% to -50% → vacancy rates escalate (baseline 10-15% → crisis 30-40%) → CRE property valuations plummet -30% to -70% from 2019 peak → refinancing cliff crisis where $1.5T loans maturing 2023-2027 underwater at 6-7% rates (vs 2% origination) → CMBS default rate explosion (<1% baseline → 5-15% crisis) → pension fund write-downs (10-20% portfolios lose 30-50% value = $50-200B) → foreclosures create zombie towers selling at 30-70¢ on dollar creating contagion risk.
