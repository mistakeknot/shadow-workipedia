# Policy Contagion Escalation

Data localization mandates spread via neighbor adoption (0.40-0.70 probability depending on political alignment) and crisis triggers (cyberattack 0.50-0.80, privacy scandal 0.30-0.60, economic protectionism 0.60-0.80), with stringency escalating from Soft ($1M-$10M compliance) → Medium ($10M-$100M) → Hard ($100M-$500M) → Extreme ($500M-$5B forced migration) as policies normalize over 5-15 year cycles.
