# Regional Cooling Pattern Attribution Monsoon Disruption Blame Cascade

SAI creates heterogeneous cooling with 40-60% variance across latitudes where polar regions cool 2-3× more than tropics, reducing equator-pole temperature gradient by 15-30% weakening monsoon circulations (Indian monsoon rainfall -10-20% for 5 Mt SO₂/year affecting 1.5B people's agriculture per Robock et al. 2008), while climate forensic attribution science achieves only 40-70% confidence (vs 95% legal threshold) creating exploitable uncertainty where India attributes crop failures to Chinese deployment with 60% confidence insufficient for international courts but sufficient for domestic war justification.
