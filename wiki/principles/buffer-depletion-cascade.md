# Buffer Depletion Cascade

JIT reduced inventory holding costs by 60-70% but eliminated shock absorbers; automotive plants average 2.5 days of parts, chip fabs 3-5 days of chemicals, supermarkets 3 days of stock—any disruption >3 days triggers production stoppage, >7 days triggers cascading tier-2/tier-3 failures as suppliers run out of their inputs.
