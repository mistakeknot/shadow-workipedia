# Labor Organizing Grievance Strike Mechanics

Grievance accumulation = PTSD + wage gap (local minimum vs US $15-25/hr) + job insecurity + disrespect → unionization probability increases → strike impact: 6-12 hour content flood (CSAM/extremism visible) → platform response: negotiate union ($50-100M/year increase) OR relocate hub (3-6 month transition chaos) OR emergency automation pivot (40-60% accuracy, genocide risk) → Nairobi walkout → regulatory shutdown threat → no good options (union power OR quality collapse OR liability explosion)
