# AMOC Sahel Monsoon Teleconnection Food Collapse Mass Displacement

Atlantic SST gradient (tropical vs subtropical) controls Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) position driving West African Sahel monsoon where AMOC collapse → North Atlantic cooling → ITCZ shifts south 2-4° latitude → Sahel loses summer monsoon precipitation reducing -30 to -50% (baseline ~400mm → <200mm) across Mauritania/Senegal/Mali/Burkina Faso/Niger/Chad/Sudan affecting 200M+ population where millet/sorghum/cowpea yields drop -40 to -70%, pastoralism collapses (livestock deaths water scarcity), fish catch declines (Lake Chad Niger River), crossing malnutrition threshold <1500 kcal/day creating famine dynamics child stunting +50-80%, mortality spikes starvation+disease, aid dependency where WFP capacity ~20M people vs demand >100M+ producing mass displacement internal refugees (rural → urban Sahel cities quadruple), regional refugees (Sahel → North Africa → Europe), Mediterranean crossings surge 10-30× increase (100K-500K/year from baseline 10K-30K) triggering European border militarization (budget +€10B-€50B annually) and geopolitical cascades regional conflicts (pastoralist-farmer violence water rights wars), jihadist recruitment (desperation +500-2,000 fighters/year), state collapse (Chad/Niger/Mali lose tax base -30-60% revenue), French/US military withdrawal (Sahel base closures) creating cumulative 5-10M displaced within 5 years, 20-50M by decade end overwhelming humanitarian capacity where reparations demands ($500B-$1T) deadlock against Europe adaptation needs (€1-2T) preventing coordinated response enabling preventable deaths 500k-5M over decade.
