# Permanent Replacement Strike Weapon Destruction

PATCO 1981 Reagan watershed normalized permanent striker replacement (legal under Mackay 1938 SCOTUS but dormant until Reagan fires 11,000 air traffic controllers) → strike credibility collapse major strikes 265/year (1970s) → 5/year (2009 nadir) → 33/year (2023 recovery) → replacement worker recruitment (temp agencies, unemployment pools, $15-25/hr premium, 2-8 week training lag) + scab protection costs ($500-5,000/day security per worker) → public opinion dynamics (pro-striker 60% → pro-replacement if strike >3 weeks + essential services disrupted) → violence escalation (anti-scab assaults 2-30% monthly probability depending on duration + desperation) → when permanent replacement used in >80% strikes (currently 40%, trajectory 80% by 2035-2045) strike weapon destroyed entirely leaving only SW#55 general strikes viable (rare/risky 60% defeat rate) creating permanent employer offensive advantage where ordinary workplace strikes become futile suicide missions.
