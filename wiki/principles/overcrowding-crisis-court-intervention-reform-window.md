# Overcrowding Crisis Court Intervention Reform Window

Capacity utilization 100-120% manageable → 120-150% stress (violence +30%) → 150-200% crisis (riots, federal court intervention) → California 180-200% (2006-2011) → Brown v. Plata 2011 ordered 33k reduction (25% mandate) → crisis urgency +25% in adoption formula overcomes lobbying resistance (-40% + 25% = -15% net) → enables reform that ideology alone cannot achieve → Texas crossed 120% (1993), built more prisons instead (ideology NC blocked reform path).
