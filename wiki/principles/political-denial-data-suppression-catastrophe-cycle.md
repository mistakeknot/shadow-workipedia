# Political Denial Data Suppression Catastrophe Cycle

Subsidence data collected → implications terrifying → data suppressed "prevent panic" → development continues on sinking land → more people at risk → more pressure to suppress → catastrophic failure (flood, collapse) → scandal, blame, recrimination → massive remediation costs OR capital relocation (10-30 year cycle, ends with crisis, transparent early warning enables planning)
