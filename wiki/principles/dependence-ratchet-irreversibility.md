# Dependence Ratchet Irreversibility

Coastal city desal dependence escalates from 10% baseline (San Diego 2015) → 30-50% (2025-2035) → 60-80% (2055-2085) as aquifer depletion (-2% to -5% annually) and climate aridity (+10% to +30%) exhaust alternatives, creating irreversible lock-in where construction lag (4-9 years USA) and contract termination penalties ($500M-$2B for large plants) make reversal structurally impossible once >60% threshold crossed.
