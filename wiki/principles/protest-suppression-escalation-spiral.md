# Protest Suppression Escalation Spiral

Militarized police crackdowns on protests (Ferguson 2014 MRAPs/snipers/tear gas, Portland 2020 federal agents unmarked vans/nightly tear gas, Cop City Atlanta 2023 kill Manuel "Tortuguita" Terán + charge 61 protesters with domestic terrorism RICO) create chilling effect on First Amendment assembly → reduced protest participation → remaining protesters more radical → police justify increased militarization → vicious cycle where consent decrees (DOJ pattern-of-abuse investigations: Ferguson, Baltimore, Chicago) are undermined by resource limits (DOJ can oversee ~20 departments, 18,000 exist) + resistance (police unions challenge reforms, arbitration overturns accountability measures).
