$220B medical debt outstanding → 550k annual medical bankruptcies (66.5% cite medical as primary) → GoFundMe $650M+ annually for medical expenses → 34% patients delay care due to cost → crowdfunding as de facto insurance system → medical tourism expansion (charity healthcare = system collapse indicator, richest nation cannot afford care, peer nations $0 medical bankruptcy, American exceptionalism in financial toxicity)
