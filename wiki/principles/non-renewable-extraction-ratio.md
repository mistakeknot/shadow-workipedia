# Non Renewable Extraction Ratio

Fossil water aquifers (Ogallala, North China Plain) deplete at 50:1 withdrawal-to-recharge ratios (0.5 inches/year recharge vs 2-3 feet/year extraction), creating irreversible exhaustion in 30-50 years with no meaningful recovery within human timescales (10,000+ years for natural refill).
