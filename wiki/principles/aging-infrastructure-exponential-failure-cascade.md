# Aging Infrastructure Exponential Failure Cascade

Reactor design life 40-60 years but 93 of 94 US reactors sought extensions to 60-80 years (99% approval rate) → component failure probability increases exponentially with age (pressure vessel embrittlement, concrete containment cracking, steam generator tube degradation, cooling pump wear) → maintenance spending inadequacy ($100M-200M/year needed vs $50M-100M spent = 50% underfunding) creates deferred maintenance backlog → when age exceeds 60 years failure probability doubles every 10 years creating compounding risk where economic pressure to extend licenses (avoid $1B-2B replacement cost) conflicts with exponentially increasing catastrophic failure probability.
