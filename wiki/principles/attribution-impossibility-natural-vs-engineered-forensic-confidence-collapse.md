# Attribution Impossibility Natural Vs Engineered Forensic Confidence Collapse

Biological attribution distinguishing natural outbreak from engineered pathogen achieves only 0-20% forensic confidence for sophisticated attacks (compared to 80-95% natural vs engineered baseline) as genome synthesis leaves no fingerprints, release mechanisms untraceable, and evolutionary convergence makes intentional gain-of-function indistinguishable from natural selection, where lag time 6-18 months between outbreak and attribution attempt allows pathogen evolution erasing engineered signatures creating permanent fog-of-war where even confirmed biological attacks remain unattributable to specific actors.
