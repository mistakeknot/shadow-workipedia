# ICE Raid Violence Escalation

ICE budget explosion ($3B → $9B 2000-2019, agents 5k → 21k) enables workplace raid escalation (500-5,000 arrests/year peak 2008) → worker armed resistance probability 1-5% (Castle Doctrine states, rural areas) + militia "citizen arrest" intervention (10-20 active groups) creates firefight risk → violence probability compounds via confusion (who's law enforcement?), crossfire, bystanders hit → detention overflow (34k capacity → 52k peak 2019) drives tent cities + disease outbreaks (flu, COVID) + overcrowding 200%+ → when raids exceed 3,000/year AND militia intervention occurs violence becomes statistically inevitable creating deadly incident probability.
