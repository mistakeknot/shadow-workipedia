# Cyber Physical Trust Cascade Collapse

Fleet hijack incident threshold `≥3 attacks (≥50 vehicles each)` proves all fleets vulnerable → public trust in security drops 0.60 → 0.30 → kill switch demands create new attack surface (if cities can disable, hackers can too) → moral hazard: AV companies resist disclosing vulnerabilities (competitive risk) while hackers exploit undisclosed flaws → ransomware adaptation: first mass-casualty cyber-kinetic attack (≥10 deaths) transforms political debate overnight.
