# Geopolitical CBDC Fragmentation Dollar Alternative Reserve Currency Warfare

CBDC enables challenge to dollar hegemony as China digital yuan plus Russia/Iran/BRICS CBDC interoperability creates alternative cross-border payment system bypassing SWIFT (US-controlled) and dollar settlement, where mBridge CBDC platform ($12B transactions 2023 pilot) demonstrates sanctions evasion capability and 90+ nations joining reducing dollar share of trade settlement from 60% (2020) to projected 40% (2035), triggering reserve currency warfare as US financial sanctions power erodes (40% global trade outside dollar system by 2040) while competing CBDC blocs (Western, Chinese, BRICS) fragment global finance into incompatible payment systems creating permanent monetary multipolarity.
