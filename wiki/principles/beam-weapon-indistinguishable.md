# Beam Weapon Indistinguishable

Any microwave or laser power transmission system capable of delivering gigawatts to Earth is physically indistinguishable from a directed energy weapon, making "civilian" SBSP inherently dual-use—measured by beam power density (10-100 W/m² for power, same for weapons with focusing), targeting precision, and weapons-to-power conversion timeline (effectively zero for existing SBSP).
