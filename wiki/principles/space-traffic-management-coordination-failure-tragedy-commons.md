# Space Traffic Management Coordination Failure Tragedy Commons

Orbital slot allocation International Telecommunication Union (ITU) first-come-first-served "use it or lose it" 7-year rule incentivizes rapid deployment ignoring congestion where collision avoidance coordination voluntary guidelines (SpaceX shares ephemeris data but delays/inaccuracies common) and ESA-Starlink 2019 incident (SpaceX non-response forced manual maneuver) and SpaceX-China near misses 2021-2022 (Tiangong station evasive maneuvers, diplomatic complaints) show coordination failure as near-miss incidents increase 10× per year with 25,000+ avoidance maneuvers per 6 months (2023) overwhelming voluntary system creating attribution disputes where close approaches (<5km threshold) blame unclear (bad ephemeris data vs intentional aggression) enabling retaliatory threats and tragedy-of-commons dynamics where each operator (SpaceX, OneWeb, Kuiper, China Guowang, military satellites) incentivized launch more satellites pursue market share/strategic advantage while imposing collision risk externality on all other operators creating collective action failure where binding international space traffic rules politically impossible (US/Russia/China veto UN Space Treaty updates, private companies lobby against restrictions) and voluntary guidelines ignored when profitable leaving orbital congestion unmanaged until Kessler threshold crossed irreversibly destroying LEO for all parties.
