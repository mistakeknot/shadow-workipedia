# Climate Conflict Nexus

African conflicts increasingly follow climate stress patterns, with pastoralist-farmer clashes, Lake Chad shrinkage, Sahel desertification, and drought-induced migration creating predictable violence corridors—measured by climate-conflict correlation (r=0.45-0.65 depending on region), pastoral route disruption incidents (up 340% since 2010), and drought-to-violence lag time (6-18 months).
