400M+ civilian firearms (120.5 per 100 people, only country with guns > population) → 48,204 annual gun deaths (2022, 14.4 per 100k) → 25× higher gun homicide rate than other high-income countries → 46% of global civilian firearms, 4% of population → constitutional protection post-Heller/Bruen expands access (American exceptionalism in gun death, proliferation drives mortality, peer nations 0.2-2 per 100k)
