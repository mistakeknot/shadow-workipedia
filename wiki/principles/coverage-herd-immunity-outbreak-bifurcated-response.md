# Coverage Herd Immunity Outbreak Bifurcated Response

Vaccine confidence erosion → coverage decline below 95% measles threshold (R₀=12-18) → 2025 Texas outbreak 1,618+ cases, 3 deaths → bifurcated response: affected communities +5-15% coverage ("my child got measles, I was wrong") vs adjacent skeptical communities -2-5% ("vaccinated got sick too, vaccines don't work") (outbreak can rebuild OR erode trust, depends on framing, herd immunity collapse self-reinforcing)
