# Zoonotic Spillover Worker Bridge Human Adaptation

Farm workers provide pathogen bridge between animals and general population where daily high-dose exposure (respiratory droplets, fecal-oral, blood contact) creates adaptation opportunities, H5N1 882 human cases with 52% fatality rate demonstrates virulence potential, Herfst/Fouchier research shows 5 mutations from pandemic capability, creating inevitable timeline where worker transmission events eventually select for human-to-human sustained transmission variant.
