# Rural Hospital Closure Medical Desert Economic Death Spiral

130+ rural hospitals closed since 2010 with 600+ at immediate risk triggers cascading failure sequence (emergency room→surgery→obstetrics→ICU→complete closure) creating medical deserts affecting 25% rural Americans (1,100+ counties without maternity care, 30-60 minute ambulance rides exceeding golden hour, physician shortage 30 vs 250 per 100k urban), amplified by economic death spiral where hospital closure drives physician exodus→population health decline→tax base erosion→county economic collapse preventing hospital reopening and forcing permanent depopulation.
