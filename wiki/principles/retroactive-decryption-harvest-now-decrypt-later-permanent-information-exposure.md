# Retroactive Decryption Harvest Now Decrypt Later Permanent Information Exposure

Quantum retroactive decryption threat creates "harvest now, decrypt later" incentive where adversaries archive all encrypted traffic 2020-2035 (50-500 EB estimated NSA/China storage) knowing future CRQC 2030-2035 will crack historical RSA-2048 in hours, permanently exposing sensitive data with classification periods 25-50 years (nuclear secrets, intelligence sources, biometric databases, medical records) as data encrypted today remains vulnerable indefinitely until post-quantum migration completes creating permanent information exposure window 2020-2040.
