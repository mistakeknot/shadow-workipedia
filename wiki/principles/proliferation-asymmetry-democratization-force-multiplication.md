# Proliferation Asymmetry Democratization Force Multiplication

Autonomous weapons proliferation creates force asymmetry where $1M AI development cost enables 10,000× force multiplication (single operator controlling 1,000+ lethal drones vs traditional 1:1 human-weapon ratio) accessible to non-state actors, as commercial drone technology ($500-5,000) plus open-source targeting algorithms (GitHub, arXiv) lowers entry barrier from $100M fighter jet requiring nation-state to $50K drone swarm achievable by terrorist organizations, establishing permanent advantage for offense as defensive systems cannot scale 10,000× to match swarm multiplication.
