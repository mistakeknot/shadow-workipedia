# Broker Platform Conflict Of Interest Customer As Product

Robinhood revenue 80%+ from PFOF (customers are product sold to Citadel) → incentivized to maximize trading volume not customer outcomes → gamification features (confetti removed post-suicide) → margin auto-enrollment → options approval with minimal knowledge testing → infinite leverage glitch (2019) → Alex Kearns suicide (misunderstood $730k margin) → customer service impossible (8M users, < 100 support staff) → "democratization of finance" = democratization of losses → IPO $38 → $7 (-82%) → customers also shareholders also product.
