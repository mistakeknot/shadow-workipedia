# Quantum Computing Speed Advantage Extinction Event

Current HFT: nanosecond advantages → quantum computing: potentially instantaneous optimization → post-quantum HFT could solve arbitrage before classical computers see the order → speed arms race reaches physical limits (light speed) → quantum advantage = market capture by 1-3 firms → current HFT firms ($50B+ infrastructure) obsolete overnight → regulatory framework assumes classical computing → quantum HFT = regulatory dark age.
