# Return Impossibility Psychological Transformation

Once colonists accept they may never return to Earth (whether by choice, cost, or physiological adaptation), psychological and political orientation shifts fundamentally toward Mars-first identity—measured by expected return rate (initially 20-50%, declining to <5% after adaptation), physiological Earth-readaptation difficulty, and Mars-born generation identity formation.
