# Service Provision Impossibility Infrastructure Deficit Permanent Underclass

Megacity infrastructure deficits prove mathematically impossible to close as backlog investment requirement $5-15T (2025-2050 global South megacities) exceeds available capital $500B-2T from municipal revenues, foreign aid, and private investment, where water coverage reaching only 40-60% population, sanitation 30-50%, reliable electricity 50-70%, paved roads 30-40% creates permanent underclass of 1-2B lacking basic services, as maintenance backlog compounds (deferred maintenance costs 4-5× initial investment) ensuring infrastructure decay accelerates creating civilization regression zones within megacities where living standards approach pre-industrial.
