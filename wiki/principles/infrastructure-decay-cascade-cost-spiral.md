# Infrastructure Decay Cascade Cost Spiral

Well age increases → cement degrades → casing corrodes → leak rates increase → plugging costs increase ($75k-3M/well by complexity/depth) → deferral incentive increases → backlog grows → crisis worsens (positive feedback: decay accelerates costs, higher costs reduce capacity, reduced capacity extends timeline, extended timeline increases decay)
