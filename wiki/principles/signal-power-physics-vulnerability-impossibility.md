# Signal Power Physics Vulnerability Impossibility

GPS civilian signal (C/A code) intentionally weak -160 dBW (weaker than background noise) requiring sophisticated signal processing but making trivially easy to overpower with fake signal → $1K SDR transmitting 0.1W spoofs 10km radius, $10K professional spoofer 50km, $100K military-grade 200km, state actors 100W transmitters spoof entire regions (Black Sea, Taiwan Strait) → detection difficult because spoofed signal looks legitimate (same frequency, stronger power, receiver locks onto it) → seamless takeover spoofing gradually drags position over 30 minutes (undetectable by signal strength monitoring alone) → countermeasure arms race futile where operators invest $50B in detection (signal strength monitoring, multi-constellation receivers, inertial backup) but attackers always win because offense cheaper than defense (open-source SDR tools proliferate, equipment legally sold as "test equipment") creating permanent vulnerability where physics of weak intentional signal design makes security impossible without complete redesign ($100B encrypted GPS III retrofit).
