# Extrinsic Incubation Acceleration Transmission Season Extension

Higher temperatures accelerate pathogen development in vectors exponentially following Arrhenius equation where each °C increase shortens extrinsic incubation period 10-20%, transmission seasons extend 30-60 days longer, urban heat islands provide 2-3°C bonus enabling year-round breeding, creating vectorial capacity explosion as faster pathogen maturation multiplies infection opportunities within vector lifespan.
