# Supply Chain SolarWinds Mass Compromise

Software supply chain compromise enables simultaneous backdoor installation across thousands of organizations (SolarWinds 2020: 18,000 organizations, Kaseya 2021: 1,500 businesses, MOVEit 2023: 2,500+ organizations) → trusted vendor update mechanism exploited → single vulnerability multiplied across entire customer base → detection lag 9 months average (SolarWinds compromised March 2020, discovered December 2020) → lateral movement from IT networks to SCADA/ICS networks (1 unpatched system → network compromise → domain admin → critical systems) → when supply chain attack achieves 1,000+ simultaneous compromises attribution becomes global crisis requiring multilateral response but coordination mechanisms don't exist creating paralysis where individual nations cannot retaliate against infrastructure shared with allies.
