# Optimism Bias Lock In

Mega-projects are systematically underestimated—Bent Flyvbjerg's research shows 9 of 10 projects exceed budget by average 45%, with "black swan" outliers at 200-400%—but approval processes reward low estimates, and once construction begins, sunk cost fallacy prevents cancellation even as costs spiral.
