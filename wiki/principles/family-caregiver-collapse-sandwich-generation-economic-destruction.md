# Family Caregiver Collapse Sandwich Generation Economic Destruction

Family caregivers reach 200M+ globally (2040) from 100M (2020) as formal care unaffordable ($50K-100K annually assisted living, $80K-120K nursing home vs median income $30K-60K), where sandwich generation simultaneously caring for aging parents and dependent children reaches 40-50% working-age population facing impossible choice between employment and caregiving, with caregivers losing $300K-500K lifetime earnings plus $50K-150K annual productivity from reduced work hours creating economic destruction for 100M+ families forced into informal caregiving bankrupting middle class.
