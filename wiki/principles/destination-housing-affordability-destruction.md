# Destination Housing Affordability Destruction

Remote worker incomes 2-4x local medians in destinations → cash offers above asking → locals priced out → service worker shortage → economic dysfunction; Boise median home price +89% (2019-2023) while median local income +15% (newcomers destroy what attracted them)
