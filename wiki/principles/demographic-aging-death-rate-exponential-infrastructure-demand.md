# Demographic Aging Death Rate Exponential Infrastructure Demand

Global aging drives death rate acceleration from 55M deaths annually (2020) to 75M (2040) to 100M+ (2060) as elderly population 65+ reaches 1.5B (2040) from 700M (2020), where end-of-life care capacity (hospice beds, palliative care, funeral services) grows only 1-2% annually vs demand growth 3-5% creating permanent infrastructure deficit, as 80% deaths require medical intervention but only 40% access hospice/palliative care ensuring widespread suffering and family caregiver collapse affecting 200M+ caregivers globally by 2050.
