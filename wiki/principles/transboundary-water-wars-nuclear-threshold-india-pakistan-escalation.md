# Transboundary Water Wars Nuclear Threshold India Pakistan Escalation

Indus Waters Treaty (1960) allocates 168 MAF but 2050 projected flow only 120 MAF creating existential scarcity between nuclear-armed India/Pakistan, dam targeting integrated into military doctrine, China Brahmaputra diversion plans threaten India/Bangladesh, Kashmir dispute overlays water crisis, escalation ladder from diplomacy→treaty breakdown→water infrastructure attacks→conventional war→nuclear threshold as glacier failure makes water conflicts zero-sum with no negotiation space.
