# Labor Force Contraction GDP Growth Impossibility Secular Stagnation

Working-age population (15-64) shrinkage 0.5-1.5% annually (Japan -0.9%, Germany -0.4%, China -0.5% projected 2025-2050) directly reduces GDP growth as labor force contraction subtracts from growth equation, where historical GDP growth = labor force growth + productivity growth means shrinking workforce requires 3-5% annual productivity gains merely to maintain current GDP (vs historical 1-2% productivity baseline), establishing secular stagnation inevitability as innovation cannot compensate for demographic headwinds creating permanent near-zero growth across 50+ nations by 2040.
