# Thermokarst Lake Lateral Expansion Methane Factory Albedo Feedback

Initial ground subsidence from ice melt creates depressions that fill with water (0.5-2m collapse), dark water absorbs 5-10× more solar radiation than surrounding tundra (albedo 0.1 vs 0.6), heating permafrost banks causing lateral retreat 0.3-2 m/year, while anaerobic lake sediments produce methane via ebullition (40-60% of emissions via explosive bubbling hotspots), creating self-reinforcing expansion where thermokarst lakes increased 25% in Alaska 1999-2014 and coalesce into mega-lakes transforming landscapes from terrestrial to aquatic.
