# Attribution Ambiguity Plausible Deniability Gray Zone Exploitation Retaliation Paralysis

Forensic evidence from seafloor scans and vessel tracking (AIS transponders frequently disabled during cable cuts per Taiwan 2023-2024 and Baltic 2024 incidents) achieves only 40-70% confidence for deliberate sabotage vs accidental anchor drag (150 natural cable faults/year provide perfect cover), where simultaneous cuts raise confidence to 70-85% ("likely" state actor) but political retaliation threshold requires 95% certainty, creating exploitable gap enabling gray zone attrition where China cuts 2-3 Taiwan cables every 6 months attributed "likely PRC" insufficient for war forcing Taiwan to accept permanent degradation.
