# Stranded Assets Resource Extraction Temporal Arbitrage Trap

Arctic oil/gas reserves $50B-$200B value encounter permafrost thaw creating extraction impossibility where ground instability makes drilling platforms fail (foundation failure same mechanism as pipelines/roads) producing temporal arbitrage where extraction must occur before thaw destroys access creating race-to-extract 2020-2040 window but extraction infrastructure (drilling rigs, pipelines, processing facilities) requires 10-20 year payback period encountering thaw acceleration where infrastructure viable 2020 becomes non-viable 2030 when thaw >1m/decade overwhelms foundation capacity creating stranded assets where $10B-$100B sunk costs (drilling platforms, pipelines, refineries) become economically worthless demonstrating boom-bust cycle where 2020-2030 extraction boom (maximize production before thaw) → 2030-2050 accelerating failures (maintenance costs explode) → 2050-2070 abandonment (infrastructure unsalvageable) but carbon emissions from extraction boom 2020-2030 (produce while still possible) accelerate global warming amplifying Arctic amplification (+0.75°C per +1°C global) creating positive feedback where extraction → emissions → warming → Arctic thaw → more extraction impossibility demonstrating tragedy-of-temporal-commons where each year's extraction (2020-2040) maximizes present revenues while accelerating future extraction impossibility but discounting 2-5%/year makes rational to extract now accept future collapse and first-mover advantage where initial extractors 2020-2030 profit maximally (infrastructure still stable, oil/gas prices high) while late extractors 2030-2040 suffer collapse (infrastructure fails, stranded assets) creating perverse incentive race-to-extract before irreversibility threshold despite collective catastrophe where total Arctic extraction 2020-2050 adds +0.1-0.3°C global warming accelerating permafrost feedback crossing runaway threshold enabling permanent climate destabilization.
