# Metal Persistence Irreversibility Zero Half Life

Heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, chromium) exhibit zero radioactive decay on human timescales making soil contamination permanent without remediation, with lead binding permanently to soil particles, mercury undergoing ongoing methylation (more toxic form), cadmium continuously taken up by plants, and arsenic maintaining high groundwater mobility, creating 450,000+ brownfield sites and contaminated farmland that cannot naturally recover requiring economic-impossibility-scale cleanup ($10M-$1B per site = exceeds GDP for comprehensive remediation).
