# Treatment Gap MAT Capacity Harm Reduction Resistance

5.6M opioid use disorder (2022) vs 22% receiving any treatment, 11% receiving MAT (methadone/buprenorphine) → abstinence-only ideology blocks evidence-based treatment → safe consumption site opposition → naloxone distribution barriers → treatment desert geography → 80% treatment gap persists (treatment system deliberately underfunded, harm reduction stigmatized, preventable deaths from treatment unavailability)
