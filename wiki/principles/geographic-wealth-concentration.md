# Geographic Wealth Concentration

Physicians cluster in affluent metropolitan areas (NYC: 400+ physicians per 100k population) while rural and poor urban areas face deserts (Mississippi: 160 per 100k)—creating 30%+ of counties with zero psychiatrists, 50%+ with zero OB-GYNs, and mortality gaps of 5-15 years between served and underserved populations.
