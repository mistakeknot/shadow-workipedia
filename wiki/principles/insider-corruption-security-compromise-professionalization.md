# Insider Corruption Security Compromise Professionalization

20-40% of major organized thefts involve utility employee collaboration → patrol schedule information + vulnerability mapping + access credentials → night operation 60-80% undetected → detection-to-arrest rate only 5-15% for organized networks → crew professionalization (trucks, cutting tools, night vision, radio scanners) → guard casualties 50+/year South Africa (insider threat = force multiplier, nearly impossible to prevent)
