# Offshore Migration Enforcement Collapse

Regulatory arbitrage drives $5-8T offshore when Basel III enforced onshore (Cayman/Luxembourg/Singapore 15%→25% of $55T shadow banking), and crossing $10T threshold (18% share, projected 2027-2029) makes regulation structurally unenforceable as race-to-bottom (-14-20% international pressure) dominates global coordination attempts
