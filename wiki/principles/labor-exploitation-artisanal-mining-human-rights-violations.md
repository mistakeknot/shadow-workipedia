# Labor Exploitation Artisanal Mining Human Rights Violations

Artisanal small-scale mining (ASM) produces 15-20% cobalt (Congo 200K artisanal miners including 40K children working 12-hour days $1-2 wages in unregulated pits with 0.1% annual mortality risk from tunnel collapse), while industrial mining displaces indigenous communities (lithium extraction Atacama region displacing 30+ communities, copper mining evicting 200K Peru/Chile 2010-2025) and enables labor violations (nickel refineries Indonesia 60-80 hour weeks, minimal safety equipment, 2-5% annual injury rates) creating human rights crisis where clean energy infrastructure built on exploited labor and involuntary displacement replicating historical colonial extraction patterns.
