# Data Asymmetry Root Cause Governance Blindness

AV companies control 100% of crash telemetry but share only 5-15%, seal 50-80% under NDAs, suppress 5-30% entirely → municipal audit capability near zero (cities cannot verify safety claims) → regulatory capture via $50-200M/year lobbying pressures NHTSA to accept self-reported stats → precedent strength accumulates +0.05 per NDA-sealed crash making future disclosure 10-20% harder → information asymmetry compounds across years (not recoverable without whistleblowers).
