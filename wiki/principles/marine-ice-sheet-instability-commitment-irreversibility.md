# Marine Ice Sheet Instability Commitment Irreversibility

West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Thwaites/Pine Island glaciers sit bedrock below sea level creating marine ice-sheet instability where ocean warming drives basal melt undercutting grounding line (where glacier meets bedrock) observing Thwaites retreat 1-2 km/year grounding line 2000-2024 (20-30km total), ice shelf thinning 4-5 m/year, with buttressing loss where ice shelf collapse removes back-pressure → glacier accelerates → faster retreat and ice-cliff failure when grounding line exposes cliffs >100m tall (structural failure ice can't support weight) triggering rapid calving accelerated mass loss crossing commitment threshold 2035-2050 window when grounding line retreats past bedrock ridge (stabilizing feature) enabling unstoppable retreat to deep basin interior irreversible within human timescales (recovery requires ice age conditions) committing 3-5m sea level rise over 100-300 years (Thwaites alone 65cm, Pine Island 50cm, total WAIS 3-5m) where 2035 trigger locks in but first 50cm takes 30-50 years (2040-2080), next 1m takes 50-80 years (2080-2150), final 1-2m takes 100-150 years (2150-2300) creating intergenerational injustice where today's players commit (decade-scale decision) but tomorrow's generations pay (century-scale impacts) and economic discounting paradox where $10T damage 2100 = $1-2T present value (2-3% discount rate) systematically underweights future catastrophe enabling present inaction.
