# Indigenous Displacement Cultural Preservation Land Rights Conflict

Arctic Indigenous population 650k total (Alaska 120k, Canada 200k, Russia 250k, Scandinavia 80k) across 1,140 settlements experiences vulnerability index = coastalExposure × infrastructureCondition × economicCapacity producing relocation triggers infrastructure failure >50%, erosion >10m/year, permafrost >2m thaw where relocation programs vary Federal buyouts USA $250k-$1M per household, Canada $300k-$800k, Russia $50k-$200k creating acceptance rates voluntary 20-60%, mandatory with compensation 60-80%, forced 90-100% with resistance and historical calibration shows Newtok Alaska 380 residents $130M relocation 2003-present ongoing voluntary 80%+, Shishmaref Alaska 600 residents $180M estimated 2016 vote 89% relocate, Russian Arctic settlements 50+ abandoned 1990-2020 with 10-30k relocated demonstrating cultural preservation challenges where traditional land access costs $50M-$200M/year, language programs $10M-$50M/year, heritage documentation $5M-$20M/year encounter language at risk if continuity <0.50 creating cultural extinction risk and land rights conflicts where Indigenous title vs resource extraction (oil/gas $50B-$200B value Arctic reserves) produces litigation $50M+ enabling indigenous vs extraction vs compromise settlements but permafrost thaw accelerates extraction impossibility (ground instability makes drilling uneconomic) creating temporal race where extraction must occur before thaw destroys access demonstrating intergenerational equity failure where current generation relocates (loses land), future generation inherits neither traditional lands nor extraction revenues producing permanent cultural displacement.
