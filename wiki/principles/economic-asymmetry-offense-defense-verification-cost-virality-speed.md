# Economic Asymmetry Offense Defense Verification Cost Virality Speed

Creating convincing deepfake costs $100-10,000 and takes hours-to-days while forensic verification costs $50,000-500,000 and takes days-to-weeks, where deepfake video reaches 10M viewers in 6 hours but fact-check reaches 100K viewers in 24 hours (100:1 exposure ratio), creating permanent attacker advantage as offense scales linearly with AI improvements while defense remains labor-intensive expert analysis, ensuring deepfakes spread 10-100× faster than verification can counter making strategic damage irreversible before truth emerges.
