# Species Network Cascade Ecosystem Services Collapse

Target species elimination mosquitoes (disease vector) triggers food web dependencies where mosquitoes constitute 30-70% bat diet, 20-50% frog diet, 5-15% Arctic tundra pollination creating predator population decline bats (insectivores) -50-80% over 10-20 years post-mosquito elimination (White Nose Syndrome 2006-2020 precedent 6-7M bats died, $3.7B agricultural impact USGS) plus birds -20-50%, fish -15-40% and pollination collapse mosquitoes contribute 5-15% Arctic/tundra pollination, elimination → plant reproduction -20-60% affected regions (similar to global bee populations -30-50% 2000-2020 causing crop losses $5-15B/year) triggering agricultural impact bat ecosystem services $3-5B/year (pest control, pollination) loss → crop yields -5-20% in affected areas and food web rewiring where prey-predator ratios shift, invasive species fill niches, ecosystem services decline $3-15B/year per region producing irreversibility where ecosystem doesn't revert if gene drive reversed because cascades continue 30-100 years post-intervention (island scenario: gene drive eliminates invasive rodent for conservation → endemic species population explosion prey release → vegetation overgrazing → soil erosion → plant extinction → herbivore starvation → predator collapse → island ecosystem state change forest → grassland permanent) demonstrating non-reversible ecosystem reorganization where biodiversity loss 10-30% species in target taxon's food web creates permanent reduction in ecosystem resilience.
