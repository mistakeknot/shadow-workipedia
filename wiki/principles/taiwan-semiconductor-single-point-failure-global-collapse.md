# Taiwan Semiconductor Single Point Failure Global Collapse

Geographic concentration creates existential vulnerability where Taiwan produces 54% global foundry capacity (TSMC 92% of advanced <7nm chips), 2021 crisis idled 11.3M vehicles ($210B losses), lead times stretched 12→26+ weeks, while reshoring impossibility ($20B fab costs, 2-3 year construction, expertise extinct since 1990s) ensures Taiwan earthquake/invasion triggers permanent global manufacturing collapse as alternative capacity nonexistent.
