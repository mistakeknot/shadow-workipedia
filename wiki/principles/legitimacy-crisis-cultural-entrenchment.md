# Legitimacy Crisis Cultural Entrenchment

Illness recognition vs denial movements determine policy trajectories where denial narrative ("invisible illness", "just lazy", "malingering") blocks accommodation mandates → workers forced to continue despite impairment → reinfection cascade worsens symptoms → exits accelerate → "see they're not really sick if they're working informally" narrative strengthens → political support for accommodations collapses → if denial dominates >5 years cultural stigma becomes permanent → recognition movements require major political shift or undeniable crisis (mass disability surge forcing acknowledgment) but 5-year delay creates 10-20M person permanent disability caste with no path to formal economy reintegration.
