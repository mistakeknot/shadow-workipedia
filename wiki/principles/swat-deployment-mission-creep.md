# SWAT Deployment Mission Creep

SWAT deployments escalate from rare high-risk scenarios 3,000/year (1980s) → routine drug policing 80,000/year (2010s, 62.5% for drug searches not hostages) via tactical drift where no-knock warrants proliferate 1,500/year (1981 hostage situations) → 60,000/year (2010s routine raids) → wrong-address probability 10-15% hits innocent targets → civilian casualties 500-1,000/year injured/killed (Breonna Taylor 2020, Aiyana Stanley-Jones 2010, Kathryn Johnston 2006) → flashbang injuries to children/elderly (Bou Bou Phonesavanh $3.6M settlement) with no corresponding public safety improvement.
