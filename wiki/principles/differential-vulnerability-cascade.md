# Differential Vulnerability Cascade

Automation displaces low-skill jobs first (manufacturing 70% → 30% employment 1900-1950), then mid-skill (clerks, bank tellers), then high-skill (engineers), creating sequential skill obsolescence waves that exceed 5% baseline retraining capacity when automation velocity surpasses absorption rate.
