# Social Media Comparison Addiction Spiral

Screen time 6-10 hours/day creates FOMO and comparison anxiety from curated feeds, displacing in-person connection (+25% loneliness at 10hr/day), driving social withdrawal→more loneliness→substance use self-medication (50-70% co-morbidity)→addiction treatment capacity shortages (detox beds, MAT programs)→more isolation reinforcing loop.
