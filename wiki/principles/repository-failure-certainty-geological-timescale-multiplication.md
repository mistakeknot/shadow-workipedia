# Repository Failure Certainty Geological Timescale Multiplication

Every geological repository failure mode (groundwater intrusion at mm/year eventually contacts waste, seismic activity unpredictable over millennia, glaciation cycles 10,000-100,000 years excavate any site, volcanic reactivation, human intrusion from future mining/archaeology) becomes probabilistically certain over 10,000+ year hazard duration, while only 1 repository exists globally (Onkalo Finland 5,500 tons capacity opening 2025) vs 70,000+ tons current inventory + 2,400 tons/year generation, leaving 440 reactor sites with spent fuel pools at 95%+ design capacity after 40+ years vs 20-year intended lifetime.
