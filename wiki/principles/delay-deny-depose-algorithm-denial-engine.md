# Delay Deny Depose Algorithm Denial Engine

Prior authorization requirements 21%→34% (2015→2024) → average approval delay 3-5 days (30+ for complex) → AI auto-denial (Cigna 1.2 seconds, 50 at a time) → medical directors 60,000 denials/month (~6 seconds each) → 80-90% appeal success rate proves bad faith → patients die/bankrupt before resolution (8% physicians report death before appeal) (inscribed bullet casings reveal algorithm, denial optimization for profit, approval delay intentional, system designed to exhaust not serve)
