# Coral Reef Bioerosion Calcification Crossover Structural Collapse

Coral calcification rates decline exponentially below Ω(aragonite) <3.3 while bioerosion (boring organisms, wave action, chemical dissolution) accelerates, crossing net erosion threshold at Ω ~3.0 (Caribbean seasonal, Great Barrier Reef 2040 projection) where reefs shift from net growth to structural collapse into rubble, losing 97%→20% wave energy dissipation and exposing coastlines to 3-5× storm damage while eliminating 100M+ livelihoods from reef tourism ($36B/year) and fisheries.
