# Biomass Collapse Protected Area Landscape Catastrophe

Measured 75% flying insect biomass decline (1989-2016 German nature reserves, 82% summer peak) in protected areas indicates landscape-level catastrophe where even reserves cannot buffer against agricultural intensification, pesticide drift, light pollution, and climate disruption, while North American bird apocalypse (2.9 billion lost 1970-2019, grassland -53%, aerial insectivores -40-60%) confirms food web cascade as insect base collapses, making measured reality worse than worst-case projections.
