# Death Ethics Transformation Mandatory Mortality Movements

Voluntary death movements (mortality as noble philosophical choice) → 2075 major religious movements demand constitutional maximum 120-year lifespans → "Only the mortal are human" new religions emerge → psychological crisis: immortal existential ennui → some immortals voluntarily choose death → mandatory death support reaches 40%+ → debate: is existence right or obligation? → forced intervention vs individual autonomy (optional mortality transforms human condition)
