# Police Complicity Violence Amplification

Police complicity formula Min(0.90, religiousNationalism × 0.50 + institutionalWeakness × 0.40) yields complicity 0.60-0.75 in Pakistan/India causing 60-75 minute delays in mob response (deliberate), arrest rate <10%, conviction <1%, creating violence amplification where complicity >0.60 triggers vigilantism +50% and spontaneous mobs +100%, normalized into impunity spiral exemplified by Pakistan Year 1 (1 killing, 0 arrests) → Year 20 (75 killings, <1% convictions) where endemic mob justice irreversible without federal intervention (religious nationalists block) and state capacity insufficient (police culture corrupted by religious nationalism)
