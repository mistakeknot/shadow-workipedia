# Drug Scarcity Botched Execution Spiral

European pharmaceutical companies boycott lethal injection drugs (2010 ban exports to US execution states) → states exhaust traditional three-drug protocols (sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, potassium chloride) → experimental single-drug/untested compound protocols (midazolam, pentobarbital from compounding pharmacies) → botched execution probability escalates (proper protocol 2% complications → experimental 50%) → multi-hour deaths livestreamed/documented (Clayton Lockett 43 minutes 2014, Joseph Wood 117 minutes 2014) → public horror (-25% support shock) → governor moratoriums (6 states) → alternative method adoption (firing squad Utah 2015, nitrogen gas Alabama 2024).
