# Severance Tax Death Spiral

Coal revenue -80% (Wyoming) and -70% (West Virginia) collapses tax base below 20% of 2010 peak triggering service austerity (schools/hospitals close, police defunded) → out-migration → tax base further erodes creating irreversible regional contraction, where pension crisis (UMW $6B shortfall, 92k retirees) compounds as worker base disappears eliminating contribution revenue while liability remains fixed
