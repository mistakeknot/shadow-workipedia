# Thermohaline Circulation Bifurcation Irreversibility Physics

Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) salinity-driven thermohaline conveyor belt transports 17-20 Sv (Sverdrups 10⁶ m³/s) historical baseline (1950-2000) delivering 1.25 PW (petawatts) heat to Europe but Greenland ice sheet mass loss accelerates freshwater flux stratifying North Atlantic surface salinity reducing vertical mixing and deep water formation sites (Labrador Sea, Greenland Sea, Nordic Seas) weakening overturning strength to 10-12 Sv (2024) 40% decline with bistability modeling where stable AMOC state vs collapsed state separated by unstable saddle-node bifurcation threshold <8 Sv creating hysteresis where recovery requires much stronger forcing than collapse trigger (post-collapse recovery 50-200 years vs collapse 5-10 years) and tipping probability rises from 5% (2024) → 40% (2035) as Greenland melt rate +200-400 Gt/year and atmospheric circulation patterns (NAO index) amplify freshwater anomalies producing abrupt nonlinear transition where gradual weakening → sudden collapse (12 Sv → 6 Sv over 5-10 years) crosses irreversible threshold rendering European climate permanently altered within player decision timeframes (2035-2050 collapse window sits within simulation scope enabling early warning agency 2024-2030 then forcing adaptation post-collapse).
