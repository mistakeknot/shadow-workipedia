# Error Production System Design Predictability

Medical errors not individual failures but system outcomes → Swiss cheese latent failures → time pressure + fatigue + cognitive overload → 250,000-440,000 preventable deaths annually (3rd leading US cause) → hospital-acquired infections 4-5% admissions → blame culture prevents learning → errors hidden not fixed (systemic production of harm, safety vs accountability tension, reporting suppressed)
