# Spent Fuel Pool Fukushima Risk Distributed Chernobyl Overhead

Temporary wet storage pools designed for 20-year cooling now hold 40-60 year inventories at 95%+ capacity with structural degradation requiring active cooling 24/7, creating Fukushima Unit 4 scenario (spent fuel pool nearly lost cooling, worse meltdown potential than reactor cores) replicated at 440 sites globally where pool fire would release 5-10× more radioactivity than reactor accident, driving dry cask emergency deployment at $1-4M each with 100-year rated lifetime vs 10,000-year requirement and elevated terrorism vulnerability.
