# Grid Collapse Cross System Instantaneous Cascade

Grid failure instantly cascades through all 18 resource systems (water pumps stop→cities lose water 24-48 hours→sewage fails→cholera risk, refrigeration dies→food spoilage 4-12 hours→supply chain collapse, life support fails→hospitals evacuate after 24-48hr generator fuel→preventable deaths surge, digital payments stop→ATMs dead→commerce freezes, cell towers 4-8hr backup→coordination impossible) where 7-day blackout creates disaster-level casualties, 30-day blackout triggers refugee flows, and permanent blackout constitutes death sentence for urban civilization requiring forced migration to electrified zones in neo-feudal geography.
