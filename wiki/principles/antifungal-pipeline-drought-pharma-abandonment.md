# Antifungal Pipeline Drought Pharma Abandonment

Only four classes of systemic antifungals exist (azoles, echinocandins, polyenes, flucytosine) vs. 15+ antibiotic classes. No new class reached market between 1990-2022. Antifungals treat acute infections (short courses, no chronic customers), target eukaryotic cells (hard to avoid toxicity), and face generic erosion—making R&D commercially unattractive.
