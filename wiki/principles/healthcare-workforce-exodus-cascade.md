# Healthcare Workforce Exodus Cascade

Healthcare workers experience 1.5-2× Long COVID exposure risk (15-25% vs 10-15% general population) creating concentration crisis → Long COVID + burnout interaction drives catastrophic 50-70% exit probability (vs 30% baseline burnout alone) → provider shortage accelerates beyond training pipeline replacement (8-12 year physician lag, 4-6 year nurse lag) → wait times spiral (primary care 4 weeks → 8-12 weeks) → sicker patients + higher per-provider load → burnout intensifies → more exits in compounding cascade → treatment capacity collapse when exits exceed 3-4% annually creates permanent shortage (projected 120K physician deficit → 150K+ with Long COVID).
