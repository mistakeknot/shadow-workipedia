# Alliance Threat Decay

Alliances persist only while shared threats remain significant (avgThreatLevel >1.5, ideologyCompatibility >0.3), with natural decay (0.1/year) occurring when threat elimination removes strategic rationale, requiring cooldown periods (180 days) between alliance changes to prevent thrash and symmetric RNG evaluation preventing asymmetric relationship instability.
