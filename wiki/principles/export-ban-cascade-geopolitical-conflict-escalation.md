# Export Ban Cascade Geopolitical Conflict Escalation

Indonesia banned exports to Singapore 2007 (prices +300%) → Malaysia sea sand ban 2019 → Cambodia banned to Singapore 2016 after 800M tons exported → Vietnam escalating restrictions since 2009 → India-Bangladesh Brahmaputra border conflicts → major supplier uses sand as leverage → export ban cascade → importing nations seek other sources → territorial disputes → diplomatic breakdown → potential armed conflict (South China Sea dredging, Mekong basin)
