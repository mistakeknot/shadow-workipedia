# Pre Storm Shutdown Impossible Dilemma

NOAA/NASA DSCOVR satellite at L1 Lagrange point provides 15-45 min CME warning before magnetosphere impact → player must decide: (1) shut down grid immediately (prevents 70% transformer damage via GIC blockers + controlled shutdown, but 2-day blackout = $50B economic loss, hospitals on emergency power, water pumps offline 3-7 days, political backlash if storm MISSES "unnecessary panic") vs (2) gamble on storm missing Earth magnetic angle (keep power on, hope for best, but if southward Bz component hits risk 628 transformers destroyed = 21-year recovery) → 15-45 min decision window insufficient to evacuate vulnerable populations (nursing homes, hospitals need 12+ hours), coordinate international response, or verify storm trajectory with certainty → no good option where shutting down prevents catastrophe but guarantees blame if wrong, gambling avoids blame if lucky but risks civilization collapse if unlucky, creating decision paralysis where optimal action (precautionary shutdown) is politically toxic unless storm definitely hits (unknowable with 15-45 min warning).
