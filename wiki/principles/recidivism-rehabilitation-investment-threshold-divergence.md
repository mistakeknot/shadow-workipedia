# Recidivism Rehabilitation Investment Threshold Divergence

Base recidivism = 0.68 USA × (1 - rehabilitation + employmentBarriers + collateralConsequences) → rehabilitation investment threshold ~$20k/year where recidivism drops <50% (USA $4k/year = 0.11 ratio → 68%, Norway $60k/year = 0.50 ratio → 20%) → employment barriers +0.30 (50-60% unemployment, Ban the Box -15%) → collateral consequences cascade: record → housing → family separation (2.7M children) → isolation → desperation → recidivism → re-incarceration (intergenerational 2× likelihood).
