# Reform Backlash Public Opinion Whiplash

Ferguson 2014 + George Floyd 2020 uprisings (15-26M participants, largest US protests) → demilitarization demands (ban chokeholds, end qualified immunity, 8 Can't Wait reforms) → modest changes (Obama 1033 restrictions 2015 ban tracked vehicles/bayonets but allow wheeled MRAPs, 50+ cities adopt reforms 2020-2021) → "crime spike" backlash (+30% homicides 2020-2021 blamed on "defund police" despite no evidence, occurred in non-defund cities) → public opinion whiplash → budget restorations (NYC -$1B 2020 → +$200M 2022, LA -$150M → +$213M 2023) → reform rollback → police union counter-mobilization (FOP 356k members, $5M+/year lobbying) → policy paralysis cycle.
