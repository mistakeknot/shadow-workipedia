# Resource Curse Perpetuation

Natural resource wealth (oil, minerals, diamonds) consistently correlates with conflict duration and intensity rather than development, with rentier state dynamics enabling elites to fund militias without taxation, creating extraction zones that foreign powers and corporations prefer unstable—measured by resource dependence ratio (>40% exports = 3x civil war risk) and extractive industry security spending (2-8% of production value).
