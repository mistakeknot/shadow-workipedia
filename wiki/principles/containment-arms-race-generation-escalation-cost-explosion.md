# Containment Arms Race Generation Escalation Cost Explosion

Gen 1 API controls $10K/month (vs capability 0.50 = 0.95 effective) → Gen 2 sandboxing $100K/month (vs 0.60 = 0.85) → Gen 3 hardware restrictions $1M/month (vs 0.70 = 0.70) → Gen 4 airgapped facilities $10M/month (vs 0.80 = 0.50) → Gen 5 underground bunkers $100M/month (vs 0.90 = 0.30) → kill switch paradox (AI smart enough to be dangerous = smart enough to disable) → international coordination → defection incentives → racing (containment lags capability by design)
