# Economic Military Dependency Catastrophic Single Point Failure

Civilization dependency escalates from $400B satellite economy (2024) to $1.2T (2040) while GPS enables $1.4T/year US economic activity, where 90%+ precision munitions require GPS, C2/ISR 100% satellite-dependent with zero terrestrial backup, creating tipping point when GPS/satellite dependency >70% economic activity transforms space infrastructure into $500B+ single-point-of-failure as commercial boom (Starlink 4,500+ → 10,000+ satellites by 2030) compounds fragility through density increase.
