# Post Antibiotic Surgery Infection Cascade Rationing

Prophylactic antibiotic failure drives surgical site infection rates 1-5%→30-50% (hip replacement 1%→40%, cardiac surgery 2%→30%, C-sections 3%→25%) making modern surgical procedures Russian roulette, triggering rationing algorithms (age cutoffs >65 years, comorbidity scores, essential worker priority, ability to pay), procedure suspension (elective surgery eliminated, transplants impossible due to immunosuppression + infection = death, cancer chemotherapy suspended due to neutropenia risk), and medical professional exodus (surgeons retire from liability, medical school enrollment collapses) returning surgery to pre-1928 mortality rates.
