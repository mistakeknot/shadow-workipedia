# Climate Disaster Design Basis Exceedance

Nuclear plants designed for historical climate extremes (100-500 year flood, 5.7m tsunami Fukushima, hurricane Category 3-4) but climate change shifts probability distributions → sea level rise +0.5-2.0m by 2100 converts 100-year coastal flood to 10-year event → extreme heat days >40°C increase 300% (2000-2050) causing cooling system overload → drought severity reduces river flow 30-50% below design basis → hurricane intensity +10-20% exceeds containment design pressure → when historical 500-year event becomes 50-year event (10× frequency increase) and multiple climate extremes compound (heat + drought, hurricane + flood) design margins erode from 2-3× safety factor to 0.8-1.2× creating vulnerability window where Fukushima-style cascade (9.0 earthquake + 15m tsunami vs 5.7m design → 3 meltdowns, 160,000 evacuated) becomes probable rather than impossible.
