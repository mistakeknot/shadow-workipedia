# Policy Contagion Regional Convergence

LA 700 sweeps/year (2022) → San Diego/Sacramento/Phoenix within 2 years (contagion weight 30% neighbor influence), or Houston Housing First 85% retention (2012) → Dallas/Austin/San Antonio within 3 years, creating competing regional models where successful outcomes spread 3× faster than failed approaches, locking in regional policy divergence (TX housing-first corridor vs CA criminalization corridor)
