# Temporal Mismatch Civilizational Continuity Impossibility

Nuclear waste remains lethally radioactive 10,000-100,000 years (plutonium-239 half-life 24,110 years) while no human civilization has survived 5,000 years (Egypt maximum), government lifetimes average 200-300 years, and languages become unrecognizable in 1,000 years, creating zero-probability institutional continuity requirement where 400+ generations must maintain monitoring/security without electricity benefit while bearing full costs, making repository warning systems fail through monument erosion, symbol misinterpretation ("danger"→"treasure"), and complete knowledge transmission loss.
