# Regulatory Arbitrage Whack A Mole Jurisdiction Shopping

Regulatory crackdown in jurisdiction A → exchange/project migrates to jurisdiction B (China ban 2021 → miners to Kazakhstan/Texas, Binance Malta → Caymans → Dubai) → regulatory arbitrage decay as major jurisdictions coordinate (G20, FATF travel rule) → jurisdiction quality score 0.0-1.0 (Switzerland 0.85, Caymans 0.70, unregulated 0.30) → coordination threshold: when G7 + China + Singapore align (probability 0.40 by 2030), arbitrage collapses → binary outcome: regulated integration OR permanent shadow economy.
