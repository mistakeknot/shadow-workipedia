# Indoor Death Zone Class Stratification Mortality Divergence

AC penetration 90% but functionality 70% (broken, can't afford to run) → summer indoor deaths 5,000-15,000/year US (undercounted) → elderly, disabled, poor die in 95°F apartments while wealthy in 72°F → heating deaths 1,500/year → combined indoor climate deaths exceed outdoor exposure → class-specific mortality divergence accelerating.
