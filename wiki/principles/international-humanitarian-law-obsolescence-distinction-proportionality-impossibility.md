# International Humanitarian Law Obsolescence Distinction Proportionality Impossibility

IHL core principles (distinction between combatants/civilians, proportionality of force, precautionary measures) become unenforceable in autonomous warfare as algorithmic target classification achieves 85-95% accuracy (vs 99%+ required for civilian protection) with 5-15% error rate causing systematic violations, while proportionality assessment requires contextual judgment (cultural significance, dual-use facilities, collateral damage prediction) impossible to encode in algorithms and swarm coordination enables disproportionate force concentration (1,000 drones simultaneously targeting single individual) with no mechanism for human intervention creating permanent IHL compliance impossibility.
