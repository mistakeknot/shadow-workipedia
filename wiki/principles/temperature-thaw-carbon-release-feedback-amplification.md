# Temperature Thaw Carbon Release Feedback Amplification

Arctic permafrost 24M km² total (17M km² continuous, 7M km² discontinuous) storing 1,700 GtC carbon (400 GtC near-surface 0-3m, 1,300 GtC deep 3-30m, 200 GtC yedoma ice-rich) experiences Arctic amplification +0.75°C per +1°C global warming (1990-2020 historical) producing thaw rate 0.5m/decade baseline → 1.5m/decade at +2°C global temperature (exponential relationship where thawDepth = baseThaw × [1 + 0.5 × tempIncrease]) triggering carbon release pathways gradual thaw primarily CO₂ (0.3-1.5 GtC/year by 2050-2100) vs abrupt thaw thermokarst lakes/wildfire primarily methane (0.1-0.5 GtC-eq/year, 15% of yedoma release) where methane GWP 80× CO₂ over 20 years creates near-term feedback amplification and additionalWarming = (methaneRelease × GWP20 × climateSensitivity) + (CO2Release × climateSensitivity) feeds back into permafrostThaw = f(globalTemp + additionalWarming) producing runaway threshold if additionalWarming > mitigationRate where current mitigation capacity ~10 GtCO₂/year vs permafrost potential 1+ GtC-eq/year enabling feedback dominance and historical calibration shows permafrost extent Alaska 80% continuous 1950s → 65% 2020, Russian permafrost temperature -5°C 1970 → -2°C 2020 southern zones, thermokarst lake expansion Siberia +10-30% area 1970-2020, estimated 2020 emissions 0.3-0.6 GtC/year comparable to Japan's total emissions demonstrating IPCC AR6 permafrost feedback +0.09 to +0.19°C by 2100 (RCP4.5-8.5) represents commitment irreversibility where once deep permafrost thaws refreezing requires centuries even if temperatures drop creating multi-century commitment from decade-scale decision.
