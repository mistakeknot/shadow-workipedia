# Regulatory Capture Ag Gag Enforcement Impossibility

Industry lobbying prevents biosecurity regulations where "ag-gag" laws criminalize whistleblowers exposing conditions, FDA guidelines voluntary with 0% enforcement, 4 companies control 80% US beef creating political pressure against reform, industry externalizes pandemic risk (~$16T COVID-19 cost) while capturing $250B/year profits, ensuring regulatory frameworks structurally incapable of addressing systemic risk.
