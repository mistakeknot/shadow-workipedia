# Delta Displacement Freshwater Lens Destruction Double Migration

Major river deltas (Nile, Ganges-Brahmaputra, Mekong, Niger) inundation displaces 200-500M where Bangladesh 30M at +1m SLR, Nile 40M, Mekong 20M, Niger 10M, Mississippi 5M with population displacement curves linear to +2m then accelerating above +2m as defenses overwhelmed but freshwater lens destruction via saltwater intrusion creates double displacement where Ghyben-Herzberg lens principle (freshwater floats on saltwater coastal aquifers) means 1m SLR pushes saltwater 40-100m inland depending on aquifer with lens destruction irreversible human timescales (decades-centuries flush salt) producing home inundation first wave (+1-2m SLR) plus drinking water loss second wave (saltwater intrusion affects 2-5× more area inland of coastline) forcing 2-5× more migrants than sea level rise alone predicts and small island states total disappearance where Maldives (500K population, 2m max elevation), Tuvalu (11K, 5m), Kiribati (120K, 3m), Marshall Islands (60K, 2m) face sovereignty questions (landless nations legal status), diaspora demands (New Zealand/Australia "climate passports"), cultural extinction and adaptation impossibility where deltas lack bedrock for pilings (soft sediment foundations fail), groundwater pumping accelerates subsidence (Jakarta/Bangkok sinking 10-25cm/year compounding SLR), seawalls require solid foundations (impossible deltas) creating permanent displacement 200-500M refugees over century with no return pathway.
