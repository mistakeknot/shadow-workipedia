# Medical Industrial Death Prolongation Suffering Multiplication

Medical technology enables death prolongation through ICU interventions, ventilation, feeding tubes, and aggressive treatments extending dying process from weeks-months (historical) to months-years (modern) with median last-year-of-life healthcare costs $80K-150K (US) vs $10K-30K earlier years, where 70% patients prefer home death but 60% die in hospitals after aggressive interventions, creating suffering multiplication as prolonged dying generates 6-18 months low-quality survival with pain, sedation, and family financial/emotional exhaustion while healthcare systems profit $500B-1T annually from end-of-life interventions incentivizing treatment over comfort.
