# Coastal Refugee Sovereignty Island Nation Extinction

Combined reef death (storm protection lost) + acidification protein collapse + sea level rise (1m by 2100) drives 200M+ coastal fishing community exodus from 70% revenue crash ($401B→$120B fisheries, 90% tourism collapse $36B→$3.6B, $1.4T real estate devaluation) while island nations (Maldives, Tuvalu, Kiribati) lose UNCLOS sovereignty when reefs no longer sustain "human habitation or economic life," triggering first documented climate-driven nation-state extinction and overwhelming urban destinations with refugee influx demanding housing/jobs/services while abandoning low-carbon coastal lifestyles.
