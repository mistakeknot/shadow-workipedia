# Thermal Runaway Cascade Physics Firefighting Impossibility

Thermal runaway triggers (damage, age, heat, charging faults) → cell-to-cell propagation 1-10 cells/minute → fire feeds itself through exothermic chain reactions → doubling intensity every 4-6 hours → water and foam ineffective (can accelerate reaction) → firefighters can only establish perimeter and wait → re-ignition risk up to 7 days post-extinguishment → Arizona APS 2019: 4-hour fire, explosion, 8 firefighters injured → South Korea 23 ESS fires in 2 years (lithium-ion fires fundamentally different from conventional fires, first responders unprepared)
