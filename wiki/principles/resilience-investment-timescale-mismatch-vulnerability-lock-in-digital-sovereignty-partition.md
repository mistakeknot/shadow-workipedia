# Resilience Investment Timescale Mismatch Vulnerability Lock In Digital Sovereignty Partition

Building resilience requires massive redundancy investment ($100-300B for 5-10× overcapacity, 5-10 years construction) or geographic diversification ($200-500B bypassing chokepoints, 8-15 years) or satellite backup ($300-800B Starlink/Kuiper constellations handling 5-15% cable traffic insufficient for full replacement, 10-20 years) or cable protection zones ($50-200B/year permanent naval patrols), where defense measured in $hundreds of billions and decades while offense measured in $thousands and minutes ensures investment always behind threat, forcing nations toward digital sovereignty ($500B-2T, 15-25 years building regional systems) creating permanent geopolitical fracture where global internet dies and trade collapses 40-70% as Cold War 2.0 digital partition becomes inevitable.
