# Infrastructure Upgrade Lag

Grid capacity upgrades require 5-10 year timelines (substation construction, HVDC transmission, permitting, NIMBY litigation adds 2-4 years) for $100M-$500M investments while AI demand doubles every 18-24 months, creating permanent lag where fast-track policies (NEPA waivers, emergency declarations) compress to 2-4 years enabling +30% capacity acceleration but externalizing environmental damage and displacement costs.
