# Conversion Paradox Regulatory Blockage

Housing shortage + office surplus creates conversion opportunity but zoning regulations + structural barriers + cost ($200-400/sqft vs $300-500/sqft new construction but regulatory timelines 2-5 years) prevent adaptation → <5% of vacant space converts → vacancy persists → property values collapse → no private investment feasible → political gridlock over zoning reform (NIMBYism, parking requirements, building codes) → if reform doesn't occur within 3-5 years conversion window closes (buildings deteriorate, owners default, regulatory inertia entrenches) → permanent mismatch between housing need and office supply.
