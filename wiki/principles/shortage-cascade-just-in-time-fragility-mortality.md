# Shortage Cascade Just In Time Fragility Mortality

Hospital inventory 3-14 days + distributor 30-60 days + manufacturer 30-90 days API = 2-6 months buffer maximum → disruption >3 months = crisis → 100-300 drugs FDA shortage list any time → 99% hospitals report shortages affecting care → rationing progression (allocation → substitution → rationing → denial → deaths) → chemotherapy shortage 2023 (cisplatin/carboplatin foundational drugs unavailable, cancer patients delayed/denied treatment)
