# Renewable Integration Frequency Instability Threshold

Solar/wind variability challenges grid frequency 59.95-60.05 Hz tolerance (California duck curve +13,000 MW evening ramp in 3 hours) while baseload plant closures reduce grid inertia, creating weekly brownouts when renewable penetration >40% without adequate battery storage (<50 GWh vs 100+ GWh needed) and baseload closures >60%, forcing "calm night" collapse scenarios (no solar, low wind) that trigger political backlash and emergency coal plant restarts.
