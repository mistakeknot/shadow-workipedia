# Attribution Unattributability Paradox Perfect Deniability Quantum Forensics Impossibility

Quantum decryption attacks achieve perfect unattributability as compromised plaintext recovery leaves zero forensic evidence (no network intrusion, no malware, no traces) with attribution confidence 0% compared to classical cyberattacks 20-40%, creating exploitation paradox where victim discovers classified data leaks years later (2035-2040) with no attribution mechanism to identify quantum-capable attacker (CRQC possession limited to 3-5 nations 2030-2035) enabling strategic intelligence theft with complete plausible deniability as quantum forensics physically impossible.
