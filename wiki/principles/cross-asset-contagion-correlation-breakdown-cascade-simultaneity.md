# Cross Asset Contagion Correlation Breakdown Cascade Simultaneity

Algorithms trade correlations (SPY tracks SPX, ETFs track baskets) → stress breaks correlations → arbitrage bots misfire → one asset crash triggers another → 2015: China stress → S&P futures → ETF discounts 50%+ → bond flash 2014 → sterling flash 2016 → crypto flash 2022 → as algorithms proliferate, correlations tighten in normal times, shatter simultaneously in stress → diversification illusion: everything correlated at the moment it matters.
