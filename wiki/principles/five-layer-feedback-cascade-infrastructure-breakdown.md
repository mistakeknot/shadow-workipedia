# Five Layer Feedback Cascade Infrastructure Breakdown

Asylum collapse → smuggling growth → more arrivals → backlog reinforcement → weaponization payment → more weaponization demands → camp permanence → statelessness → return impossibility → duration increase (system stress = arrivals/processing capacity × weaponization risk) → >2.0 legal pathways collapse, >5.0 infrastructure breakdown, >10.0 mass displacement without processing (1951 framework cannot scale to climate-driven tens of millions, infrastructure failure not border security failure)
