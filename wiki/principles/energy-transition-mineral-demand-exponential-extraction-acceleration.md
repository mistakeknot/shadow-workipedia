# Energy Transition Mineral Demand Exponential Extraction Acceleration

Green energy transition requires critical mineral production increases 4-6× (2020-2040) as EV batteries need lithium (42× increase), cobalt (21×), nickel (19×), rare earths (7×), copper (2×), where single EV battery contains 8kg lithium, 14kg cobalt, 20kg nickel vs ICE vehicle <1kg total, and renewable energy infrastructure (wind turbines, solar panels, grid batteries) demands additional 3-4× mineral volumes creating extraction acceleration from 500K tons lithium (2020) to 3-4M tons (2040) with similar exponential growth across all critical minerals ensuring unprecedented extraction pressure on concentrated geographic reserves.
