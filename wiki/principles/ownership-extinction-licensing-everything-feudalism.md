# Ownership Extinction Licensing Everything Feudalism

Physical ownership → digital license transition 5%/year → you "own" nothing (iTunes library revocable, Kindle books deletable, BMW heated seats subscription) → Terms of Service = new landlord → average consumer "licenses" 50+ products → John Deere tractor repair criminalized → property rights hollowed → neo-feudal rental class emerges.
