# Age Selective Migration Brain Drain

Net youth emigration of 5-15% of cohort from developing economies (Philippines: 2M+ workers abroad, 8% of working-age population) creates permanent income gradient feedback where diaspora remittances (5-30% of recipient household income) stabilize rural retention temporarily, but selection effect (selective outmigration of highest-educated 20-40%) reduces domestic human capital growth by 2-4 percentage points annually, compounding over 30 years into 40-60% lower development trajectories (Philippines per-capita $3.3k vs Thailand $7.2k, similar 1990 baseline)
