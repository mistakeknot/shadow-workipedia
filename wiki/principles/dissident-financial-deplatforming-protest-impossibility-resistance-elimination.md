# Dissident Financial Deplatforming Protest Impossibility Resistance Elimination

CBDC enables instant financial deplatforming where dissidents/protesters lose transaction capability without due process, as Canadian trucker protest 2022 demonstrated freezing 200+ bank accounts via emergency powers, but CBDC makes freezing instantaneous and complete (no cash alternative, no crypto off-ramp, no informal economy) where political opposition becomes financially impossible as donation to disfavored causes triggers account restriction, protest participation tracked via location data blocks future transactions, and algorithmic reputation scoring prevents dissidents from economic participation creating resistance elimination infrastructure requiring only authoritarian political will to activate.
