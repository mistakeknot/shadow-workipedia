# Carbon Credit Fraud Additionality Verification Crisis

Well plugging carbon credits $50-100/tonne CO2e = $500-2,000/well potential → verification standards weak → additionality testing (would it happen anyway?) manipulable → double-counting risk → fraud vector emerges → actual vs. claimed emission reductions gap → credit market integrity collapse if scaled without reform (IRA $4.7B 2022 covers ~30-50k wells, 5% of problem, needs 10× sustained funding)
