# Family Separation Tracking Failure Trauma

Zero tolerance policy (2017-2018) criminal prosecution of all border crossers drives child separation (5,500+ ages 0-17) since children can't be in adult detention → inadequate record-keeping creates tracking failure (1,500 "lost" = 20-30% lack records of which parent, where deported) → reunification logistics nightmare (parents deported to violence-ridden countries, NGOs search for years, only 600/5,500 reunited by 2023) → trauma epidemic (PTSD 30-50%, developmental delays, suicide attempts) creates generational harm → deportation recidivism (30-40% re-enter within 1 year due to family ties) perpetuates cycle where mixed-status families (4.5M US citizen children with undocumented parents) face permanent instability.
