# False Surrender Broadcast Fleet Stand Down Surprise Attack Tactical Defeat

Fleet receives audiovisual order to "cease hostile actions, return to port" with 60-85% forensic confidence (video artifacts detectable but not conclusive) contradicted by encrypted text-only countermand (85% confidence authentic), creating 30-minute decision paralysis where standing down causes 30-70% fleet casualties from surprise attack if video fake, ignoring causes insubordination crisis if video authentic (5-15% probability), and delaying for verification compromises strategic position regardless of eventual verification outcome demonstrating no-win dilemma.
