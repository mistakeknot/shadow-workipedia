# Remittance Corridor Fragility Migrant Livelihood Dependency

$650B+ annual remittances (2022) → 200M migrants support 800M dependents → remittance corridors vulnerable to: correspondent banking exit (de-risking), sanctions (Venezuela, Afghanistan), stablecoin collapse (crypto remittance growing), currency crisis (receiving country) → corridor closure = immediate humanitarian crisis → Philippines receives $36B (9% GDP), Mexico $60B, India $100B → single corridor disruption affects millions within days.
