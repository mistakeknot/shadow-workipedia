# Kessler Cascade Threshold Irreversibility Permanent Orbital Denial

Debris density >10,000 objects >10cm in LEO crosses self-sustaining cascade threshold where collision physics (10 km/s average = 50 MJ per 1kg = 12kg TNT equivalent) generates 1,000-10,000 fragments per collision creating exponential growth unstoppable once started, with orbital decay requiring 40-100 years depending on altitude (805km Fengyun debris 40+ years) making LEO unusable for generations as debris cleanup physics impossible at scale forcing civilization to wait 50-100 years natural decay reverting to pre-1960s capabilities (no GPS, weather satellites, earth observation, modern warfare).
