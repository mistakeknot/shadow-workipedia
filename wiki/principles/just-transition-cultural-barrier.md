# Just Transition Cultural Barrier

Promised $200M retraining delivers <$50M (2015-2020) creating 15% re-employment rate, but "coal is king" cultural identity creates place attachment that reduces participation even when funded (40% success ceiling vs 40% oil worker success), where cultural identity → transition resistance → economic collapse → identity crisis feedback loop makes rational policy adoption structurally impossible until identity transformation occurs (generational 20-40 year timeline)
