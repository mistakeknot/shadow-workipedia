# Trust Erosion Cascading Interconnected Institutional Collapse

Institutional trust collapses across interconnected spheres where university trust falls from 57% (2015) to 36% (2023), media trust 32% to 16%, government trust 22% to 11%, creating cascade as failures in one domain undermine others (student debt crisis → expert authority collapse, media misinformation → government illegitimacy, political corruption → university politicization), establishing trust floor <15% across major institutions by 2030-2035 where majority population considers core institutions fundamentally illegitimate creating governance impossibility as collective action requires minimal trust threshold 30-40% for policy compliance.
