# Peak Water Over Allocation Trap Permanent Scarcity

Temporarily increased melt (2000-2030) creates false security where governments allocate water based on unsustainable peak flows, Indus peak 2030-2040 (60% glacier-fed dry season), Ganges 2040-2050 (30% glacier), locking in irrigation infrastructure and agricultural patterns that become impossible to sustain post-peak when rivers lose 30-70% dry season flows, creating irreversible over-commitment trap as infrastructure investments prevent adaptation.
