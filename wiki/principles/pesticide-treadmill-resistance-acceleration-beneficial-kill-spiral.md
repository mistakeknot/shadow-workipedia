# Pesticide Treadmill Resistance Acceleration Beneficial Kill Spiral

Target pest resistance evolution drives dose escalation and new chemical deployment creating inescapable treadmill where resistance breeds stronger pests requiring more toxins that kill beneficial insects (non-target mortality), while synergistic toxicity (pesticide + fungicide combinations worse than additive) and systemic persistence (neonicotinoids in soil/water/plant tissues for years) accelerates collapse, with regulatory capture (chemical lobby prevents bans despite overwhelming evidence like EU 2018 restrictions) maintaining destructive cycle toward ecosystem sterility.
