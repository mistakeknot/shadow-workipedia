# Consolidation Oligopoly Capture

Market concentration accelerates from 50-100 fragmented operators (2000-2020, private <30% share) → 10-20 major players (2020-2035, private 50-60%) → 3-5 global trusts controlling 70-80% capacity (2035-2055) via M&A probability 0.40-0.70 during scarcity, enabling rent extraction escalation from competitive 5-8% margins → oligopoly 12-18% → monopoly 20-30% with regulatory capture (campaign contributions $10M-$50M → rate approval 0.70-0.90 probability).
