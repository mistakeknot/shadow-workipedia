# Bioaccumulation Food Chain Trophic Magnification

Heavy metals concentrate up food chains through bioaccumulation where each trophic level accumulates 2-10× higher concentrations (cadmium in phosphate fertilizers → crops → livestock → humans, mercury in aquatic systems → fish → apex predators), creating persistent exposure even at low soil concentrations while crop rejection from markets occurs when plant uptake crosses safety thresholds, forcing land abandonment as decades of gradual accumulation from fertilizers, biosolids, irrigation, and atmospheric deposition make agricultural continuation impossible.
