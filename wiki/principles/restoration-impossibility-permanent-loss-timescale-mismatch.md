# Restoration Impossibility Permanent Loss Timescale Mismatch

Collapsed freshwater systems cannot be restored within human timescales where dam removal economically/physically impossible (mega-dams cost billions, structural integration prevents removal), species extinctions final (200+ Lake Victoria cichlids extinct permanently), invasive eradication failures (Asian carp $1B spent, zero progress), contaminated sediment traps (century cleanup timelines), making all freshwater fishery collapse permanent on civilization timescales.
