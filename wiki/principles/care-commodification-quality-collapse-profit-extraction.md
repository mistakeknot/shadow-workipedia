# Care Commodification Quality Collapse Profit Extraction

Care provision shifts from community/family to commodified services where private equity consolidates nursing homes (60% US nursing homes PE-owned generating 20-40% profit margins), home care agencies, and hospices prioritizing profit over quality resulting in understaffing (1 aide per 15-20 residents vs 1:5 adequate), medication errors (50% residents receive inappropriate prescriptions), and abuse (30% residents experience neglect/abuse), creating quality collapse as profit extraction removes resources from care delivery ensuring systematic maltreatment of 10M+ vulnerable care recipients.
