# Prison Industrial Lobbying Escalation Cycle

Private prison corporations (CoreCivic/GEO Group 0 beds 1980 → 130k 2012, 8.4% market share) invest 0.3% revenue (~$10M+/year) in lobbying via ALEC model legislation (50 bills/year, 200 legislators influenced) → occupancy guarantee contracts (80-100% guaranteed beds, government pays for vacancies) create structural pressure to fill prisons → guard unions (CCPOA $7M/year 1990s-2000s) oppose sentencing reform → mandatory minimums + three strikes laws → prison population explosion (500k 1980 → 2.3M 2008) → private prison revenue growth ($50M 1983 → $1.9B 2019) → increased lobbying capacity reinforcing cycle.
