# Bypass Transition Non Linear Crisis Acceleration

Mass casualty incident (≥10 fatalities single crash) bypasses insurance crisis → direct municipal ban cascade (probability 0.15) → federal preemption before insurance collapse bypasses directly to jurisdictional gridlock (probability 0.25, industry lobbies hard) → recovery from cyber-kinetic crisis possible only via full transparency + mandatory kill switches + security overhaul (probability 0.05, requires unprecedented coordination) → non-linear paths enable emergent crisis trajectories.
