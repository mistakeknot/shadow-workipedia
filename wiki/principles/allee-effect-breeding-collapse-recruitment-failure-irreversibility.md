# Allee Effect Breeding Collapse Recruitment Failure Irreversibility

Fish populations below critical density experience exponential mating failure (Allee effect) where recruitment crashes even when fishing stops, giant catfish historical 50,000 populations reduced to 100 individuals (<1 ton total biomass globally), migratory species 76% population decline since 1970, -94% biomass of species >30kg, creating threshold where recovery impossible as remaining individuals cannot locate mates across fragmented habitat even under complete protection.
