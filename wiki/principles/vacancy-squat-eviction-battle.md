# Vacancy Squat Eviction Battle

Unhoused population + vacant buildings + enforcement gaps create occupation conditions → 10-100+ squatted buildings in major cities → eviction battles where squat population × political support (housing activists, mutual aid networks) vs property rights (landlords, police) determines outcomes → media coverage creates "lawless downtown" narrative regardless of scale → political weaponization drives capital flight → if austerity prevents enforcement the squats persist creating de facto social housing but if eviction succeeds buildings remain empty while homelessness continues → conversion paradox (need housing, have buildings, can't connect them) creates legitimacy crisis for property system.
