# Gerontocracy Power Accumulation Compound Interest Over Centuries

Immortal leaders never retire → average Senate tenure 42 years, median age 78 biological 55 → CEO median tenure 42 years (same individuals) → wealth compounding over 150+ year lifespans → 2058 Fortune 500 top 100 families hold 60% global wealth → institutional sclerosis 0.80+ (resistance to change from entrenched leaders) → succession crisis: youth locked out 35+ years → youth movements demand term limits, wealth caps, forced retirement (compound interest + immortality = unbridgeable wealth divide)
