# Ransomware Payment Coordination Failure Tragedy

Individual organizations rationally pay ransoms (hospital: save lives NOW, city: restore 911, enterprise: prevent data leak) but collectively payments fund more sophisticated attacks creating tragedy of commons → ban ransom payments creates worse outcome (systems down months: Baltimore 3 months $18M cost, Change Healthcare 3 weeks 1/3 US prescriptions affected) → allow payments funds gang professionalization ($100M+ annual revenue enables RaaS infrastructure, zero-day purchases, vulnerability research) → when cumulative deaths exceed 10,000 (projected by 2030: 560 attacks/year × 10 deaths avg = 5,600/year) political pressure for extreme measures (ban cryptocurrency, nationalize cybersecurity, martial law for critical infrastructure) but no coordination mechanism exists to solve collective action problem where individual survival incentives guarantee payment continuation.
