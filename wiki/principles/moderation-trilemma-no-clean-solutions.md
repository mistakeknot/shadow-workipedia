# Moderation Trilemma No Clean Solutions

Human moderation → 40%+ PTSD rate (exceeds combat veterans), labor exploitation, $100M+ lawsuit exposure BUT catches nuance/context → AI automation → fast/cheap BUT hallucinates catastrophically (censors dissidents, misses genocide Myanmar 25,000 deaths, Ethiopia 600,000+), requires massive training data labeled by...traumatized humans → reduce content velocity → lose 10-30% users to competitors, advertisers flee (no option avoids harm, only distributes it differently)
