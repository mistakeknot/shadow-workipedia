# Non Grid Infrastructure Cascade Transit Telecom Agriculture

Railway signal cable theft → 8,000+ hours UK delays annually, £35M/year → telecom copper theft → 100+ 911 outages/year US → street lighting → crime increases, accidents → water system controls → pump failures → agricultural irrigation → crop losses millions per incident → South African rail 30%+ copper stripped some lines (all copper infrastructure vulnerable, not just power)
