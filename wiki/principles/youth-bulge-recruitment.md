# Youth Bulge Recruitment

Median age of 19 combined with 60%+ youth unemployment creates permanent recruitment pool for armed groups offering salary, purpose, and belonging that states cannot match—measured by youth unemployment-to-insurgent recruitment correlation (r=0.72), armed group monthly salary vs. formal sector wage ratio (often 2-5x), and average combatant age by conflict (typically 16-24).
