# Pteropod Collapse Trophic Cascade Salmon Whale Starvation

Arctic/Antarctic waters crossing Ω(aragonite) <1.0 (pH ~7.8 projected 2040-2050) triggers pteropod population collapse as shells dissolve faster than formation, cascading through food webs where salmon depend 30-60% on pteropod diet, seabirds 30-60% on forage fish, baleen whales directly on pteropods/krill, creating 40-70% population crashes across trophic levels with 5-15 year time lags as each predator level exhausts alternative prey before collapse accelerates.
