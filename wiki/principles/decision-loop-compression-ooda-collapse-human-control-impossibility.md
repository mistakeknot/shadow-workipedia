# Decision Loop Compression OODA Collapse Human Control Impossibility

Autonomous weapon systems compress OODA loop (observe-orient-decide-act) from human baseline 3,000-5,000ms to machine 100-500ms establishing 6-50× speed advantage where meaningful human control becomes physically impossible as kill chain completion (target identification → weapons release → impact) achieves 0.3-2.0 seconds for drone swarms leaving humans only 2-17% decision timeline, forcing operational choice between combat effectiveness (full autonomy) and legal compliance (meaningful human control) with no technical solution bridging gap as physics prevents human reaction speeds matching algorithmic warfare.
