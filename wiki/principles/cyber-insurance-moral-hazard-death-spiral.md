# Cyber Insurance Moral Hazard Death Spiral

Cyber insurance market growth $2.5B (2015) → $10B (2021) → $20B projected (2025) creates moral hazard where insured organizations spend 20-30% less on cybersecurity ("insurance will pay") → insured organizations 2× more likely attacked (attackers check insurance databases) → premium explosion +300-400% (2020-2022), deductibles $500k → $5M, ransom sub-limits imposed → coverage withdrawal (AXA France 2021, Lloyd's catastrophic event exclusions 2022) → insurer loss ratios >100% (2020: 145%, 2021: 73%, 2022: 60% still unprofitable) → if loss ratios >80% for 3+ consecutive years market collapses (no coverage available) → organizations self-insure inadequately → catastrophic losses → bankruptcy cascade → remaining insurers exit creating uninsurable risk category.
