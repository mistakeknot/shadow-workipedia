# Export Control Jurisdiction Arbitrage Regulatory Collapse

Wassenaar Arrangement 42 members (US, EU, Israel, Japan, Australia) restricting "intrusion software" exports Category 4.A.5 faces compliance erosion where Israel exempts NSO Group (2016-2021 national security exception), EU members split interpretation (France lenient, Germany strict), US ITAR exemptions "allied governments" enabling vendor relocation threats (NSO Group Israel → Cyprus → Luxembourg if banned, Candiru shell companies 5 jurisdictions simultaneously) and sanctions evasion after blacklisting US Entity List (NSO Group Nov 2021 stock -40% but sales continue via front companies 2-year enforcement lag) creating export license denial 20-40% applications (2018-2023) but denials unenforceable vendor relocates (regulatory arbitrage precedent nuclear tech 1970s) where Wassenaar walkout risk if 3+ major exporters (US/EU/Israel) lose consensus vendors relocate en masse to non-compliant jurisdictions (UAE, Russia, China) making oversight impossible while supply continues unabated and enforcement gap where commercial spyware legal in democracies (vendor HQ US/Israel/Europe) selling to authoritarian clients (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, Morocco targeting democratic dissidents) creates human rights accountability vacuum where democratic export controls paradoxically strengthen authoritarian surveillance by pushing vendors beyond legal reach.
