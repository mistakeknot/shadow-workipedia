# Port Congestion Geographic Cascade Entire Coast Gridlock

Shipping bottlenecks spread systematically where Ever Given Suez blockage (6 days halted $54B, 400+ ships delayed) demonstrates fragility, port congestion cascades as LA/Long Beach backup (100+ ships, 40-day waits) diverts cargo to Oakland→Oakland backs up→Seattle→Vancouver until entire West Coast gridlocked, while empty container crisis (stranded inland, return shipping more profitable than waiting) compounds recovery to 3-6 months for single 6-day event.
