# Insurance Market Collapse Actuarial Impossibility

When actuarial data access <0.30 (data blackout), risk becomes unpriceable → premium uncertainty exceeds ±60% → carrier participation drops 90% → 50% → 30% as major carriers exit (herd behavior: first exit triggers 3-5 more within 18 months) → state risk pool formation when uninsured fleet >15% (5+ states) → path dependency: once state risk pools form, private market reentry structurally difficult (sunk cost + regulatory capture).
