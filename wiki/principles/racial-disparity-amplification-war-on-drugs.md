# Racial Disparity Amplification War On Drugs

War on Drugs policies (Reagan-era mandatory minimums, crack vs powder cocaine 100:1 sentencing ratio 1986-2010, reduced to still-discriminatory 18:1 by Fair Sentencing Act 2010) drive systemic racial disparities where Black Americans arrested 2.5× rate for drug offenses despite similar usage rates, receive 1.3× longer sentences for same crimes, and incarcerated at 5× white rate (2,272 per 100k vs 392 per 100k 2023) via enforcement asymmetries (NYC stop-and-frisk 685k stops 2011 peak, 52% Black 31% Hispanic, 88% innocent) and school-to-prison pipeline (zero-tolerance policies + school police).
