# Workforce Exodus Burnout Moral Injury Death Spiral

Post-COVID healthcare worker exodus (500,000+ quit 2021-2022) driven by physician burnout escalation (38%→63%), nurse burnout epidemic, unsafe patient ratios (1:4 required→1:8+ actual), moral injury from providing substandard care, violence against workers, and travel nurse wage compression resentment creates self-reinforcing spiral where higher workload→more burnout→more quits→higher workload per remaining staff, while nursing shortage projected 1.1M by 2030 faces pipeline constraints (80,000 qualified applicants rejected annually due to faculty shortage, clinical rotation scarcity) making workforce replacement structurally impossible.
