# Extraction Environmental Destruction Sacrifice Zone Creation

Critical mineral extraction creates environmental destruction zones where lithium extraction consumes 500K liters water per ton (Atacama Desert aquifer depletion 65% in 25 years threatening 2.5M people water security), cobalt mining produces 140M tons toxic waste annually (tailings dams collapse risk affecting 10M+ downstream), rare earth refining generates 2,000 tons radioactive waste per 1,000 tons minerals (Baotou toxic lake 10km² in Inner Mongolia), establishing sacrifice zones where local environmental costs (water depletion, toxic contamination, ecosystem collapse) subsidize global climate benefits creating colonial extraction pattern where Global North consumption powered by Global South environmental destruction.
