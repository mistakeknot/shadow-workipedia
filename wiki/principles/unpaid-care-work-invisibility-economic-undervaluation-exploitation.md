# Unpaid Care Work Invisibility Economic Undervaluation Exploitation

Unpaid care work performed predominantly by women (75% of 16.4B hours daily global care work) remains economically invisible valued at $0 in GDP despite economic value $10-15T annually (10-15% global GDP), where care workers earn median $12-15/hour (30-50% below comparable education jobs) and family caregivers receive zero compensation despite 20-40 hours weekly caregiving valued at $500B-1T annually in foregone wages, creating exploitation system where essential care labor subsidizes formal economy through systematic undervaluation ensuring care provider impoverishment.
