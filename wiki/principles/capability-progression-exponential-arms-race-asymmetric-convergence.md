# Capability Progression Exponential Arms Race Asymmetric Convergence

Offensive capability progression USA 0.30→0.92, Russia 0.20→0.87, China 0.10→0.82 over 1990-2025 → budget growth tracks capability ($100M→$28B USA, $10M→$14B China) → zero-day stockpiles expand (5→300 USA, 1→250 China) → convergence at top tier (0.80-0.92 range) creates near-peer competition → capability asymmetry drives arms race (gap >0.15 triggers budget +25% counter-investment) → MAD recognition when both sides >0.75 offensive + >0.70 vulnerable slows race (×0.50 fiscal fatigue).
