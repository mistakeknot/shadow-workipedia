# Liquidation Cascade Spiral Collateral Death Loop

Overcollateralized lending (150%+ collateral ratios) creates liquidation thresholds → price drop → liquidations → forced selling → more price drops → more liquidations → death spiral → March 2020: ETH -50% in 24 hours → $8.3M in zero-dollar liquidations (network congestion prevented bids) → May 2022: LUNA/UST death spiral ($40B → $0) → circuit breakers difficult in decentralized systems (who has authority to pause?).
