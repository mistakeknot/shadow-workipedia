# Extraction Depletion Desert Sand Unusability

50 billion tons/year global extraction (2× natural river replenishment) → desert sand too round (wind-polished) for concrete → Dubai imports sand from Australia despite being in desert → China used more concrete 2011-2013 than US entire 20th century → Mekong extraction 50-60M tons/year (3× replenishment) → Singapore expanded 24% through land reclamation (517M tons cumulative) → river/marine/beach sand finite, desert infinite but useless (angular grain requirement = geographic constraint)
