# Sovereign Debt Hidden Liability Materialization Cascade

Off-balance-sheet pension liabilities (often 3-5× reported national debt) suddenly materialize as contingent→probable→certain debt when demographics cross tipping points, triggering credit downgrades (Illinois near junk status), interest rate spikes, debt spirals, and eventual IMF interventions suspending democracy to force restructuring (Detroit emergency manager cuts "protected" pensions 4.5%, Greece troika imposes 14 separate pension cuts 2010-2018), with contagion spreading through bank holdings of government debt, insurance company solvency crises, corporate pension obligation failures, and municipal bankruptcy waves.
