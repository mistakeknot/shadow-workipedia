# Contagion Interconnectedness Financial System Cascade Impossibility Isolation

Sovereign defaults trigger contagion through interconnected financial system where $13T emerging market debt held by developed nation banks creates exposure chain (Argentina defaults → European banks lose $50B → credit crunch → corporate bankruptcies → pension losses → political crisis), and CDS (credit default swap) markets $10T notional value amplify losses 5-10× through derivatives, making isolated default impossible as 2008 demonstrated $700B subprime losses triggered $15T global bailouts establishing default cascade inevitability once threshold nations (10+ major economies) simultaneously exceed sustainability.
