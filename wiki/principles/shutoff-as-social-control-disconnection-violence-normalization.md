# Shutoff As Social Control Disconnection Violence Normalization

Utility shutoffs as punishment (600,000+ water disconnections/year) → internet disconnection = can't work, can't school → no due process, minimal appeal → reconnection fees $50-200 extortion → shutoff→eviction→homelessness pipeline established → "pay or freeze/cook" normalized as acceptable.
