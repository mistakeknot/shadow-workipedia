# Attribution Confidence Collapse Forensic Exhaustion

Attribution confidence by origin type: natural 85% → engineered 55% → crude AI 40% → sophisticated AI 10-20% → AI-generated cover stories create plausible zoonotic pathways and fake phylogenies → forensic methods exhausted when narratives equally plausible → attribution confidence <30% triggers deterrence collapse (cannot retaliate against unknown attacker) → public trust destruction when "we'll never know" normalized.
