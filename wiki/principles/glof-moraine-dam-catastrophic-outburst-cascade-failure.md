# GLOF Moraine Dam Catastrophic Outburst Cascade Failure

Glacier retreat creates 3,000+ glacial lakes (200+ dangerous) behind unstable moraine/ice dams where single trigger event (earthquake, rainfall, ice avalanche) releases millions cubic meters in minutes, Kedarnath 2013 killed 5,700+ people, Chamoli 2021 obliterated two hydropower plants (200 deaths), Imja Tsho 6 km² lake threatens 100K people, frequency accelerating from major GLOF every 3-5 years (1990s) to 1-2 years (2020s) to multiple/year (2030s projected), with cascade potential where dam failures trigger downstream chain reactions.
