# Research Funding Collapse Innovation Slowdown Feedback

LHC helium inventory 120 tons (largest single user) → university labs 5-10% consumption → labs can't afford helium → experiments cancelled → superconductor/quantum research slows → technologies that could reduce helium demand delayed → research priced out → innovation slows → helium costs >30% physics lab budget = research funding collapse threshold → fundamental research moves to wealthy institutions only (research cutback → innovation slowdown → alternatives delayed → more research cutback)
