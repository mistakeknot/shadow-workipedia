# Biological Class Divide Healthcare Apartheid Insurance Collapse

Two-tier medical divergence → lifespan stratification as rigid caste system → 2073 "Treatment raids" on longevity clinics weekly occurrence → dating/marriage taboo across century gaps (200-year-old dating 30-year-old) → insurance actuarial tables meaningless (rich live 3× longer) → labor split: immortal "knowledge workers" vs mortal "service workers" → gated immortal communities (security against treatment raids) → poor trapped in mortality, rich escaped it
