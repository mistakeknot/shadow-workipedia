# Erosion Regeneration Asymmetry Irreversibility

Topsoil erodes 10-40 tons/hectare/year under conventional tillage (10-100× no-till rates, extreme weather 1.5-3× amplification) vs 1 ton/year natural regeneration, with 100-1000 years required per inch recovery, driving USA 50% topsoil loss since 1850s (Iowa 14-16"→6-8" depth) toward desertification threshold <4 inches by 2060 if erosion >30 tons/hectare/year sustained >20 years.
