# External Intervention Backfire

Every major external intervention (French Sahel, US Somalia/Libya, UN everywhere) has either failed, created new instabilities, or been perceived as neo-colonial, generating anti-intervention nationalism that benefits insurgents—measured by intervention fatigue index, post-intervention stability scores (-23% average), and anti-Western sentiment correlation with intervention duration (r=0.67).
