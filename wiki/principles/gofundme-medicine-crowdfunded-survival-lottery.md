# GoFundMe Medicine Crowdfunded Survival Lottery

250,000+ healthcare campaigns/year + only 12% reach goal + median raised $1,970 vs $10,000+ needed → crowdfunding = lottery for survival → 1.3M Americans ration insulin + 3-5 documented insulin deaths/year (vastly underreported) → 29% skip medications due to cost + 25% delay/avoid care → 26,000-45,000 preventable deaths/year from affordability barriers (healthcare access determined by social media virality and network wealth)
