# Backfire Effect Correction Paradox

Fact-checking corrections reach only 10-30% of original false content audience due to timing lag (24-72 hours behind viral spread) and algorithm de-prioritization, but trigger backfire effects in 10-25% of believers via identity-protective cognition (corrections strengthen beliefs when identity-tied), while out-group source corrections produce 2-3× lower belief change (5-15% update rate) than in-group corrections, creating net-negative intervention scenarios for polarized populations.
