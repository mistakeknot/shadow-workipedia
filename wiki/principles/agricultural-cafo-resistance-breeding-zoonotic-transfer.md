# Agricultural Cafo Resistance Breeding Zoonotic Transfer

Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) use 70% of US antibiotics (63,000 tons/year vs 8,000 tons human medicine) for growth promotion/prophylaxis in 10,000+ animal facilities creating perfect resistance incubators, with zoonotic transfer via contaminated meat (47% US retail samples carry resistant bacteria), manure→soil→water environmental spread, and occupational exposure (30% farm workers carry livestock-associated MRSA), amplified by economic pressure where antibiotic-free production costs 10-15% efficiency loss + 40-100% price premium consumers resist.
