# Demographic Inevitability Boomer Aging Care Impossibility

Baby Boomer aging guarantees demand explosion (73M Americans >65 by 2030 needing 3× more care than younger cohorts) while workforce/infrastructure/funding to deliver care don't exist (nursing shortage 1.1M, rural hospital closures accelerating, Medicare insolvency 2030s projected), creating mathematically certain care impossibility where 20%+ elderly population requires care from <5% healthcare workforce while GDP share exceeds economic carrying capacity, forcing de facto rationing, family caregiver burden return, elderly poverty from care costs, and life expectancy reversal.
