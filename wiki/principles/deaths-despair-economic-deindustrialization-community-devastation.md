# Deaths Despair Economic Deindustrialization Community Devastation

Rust Belt + Appalachia economic collapse → deindustrialization hopelessness → self-medication → deaths of despair (opioids + suicide + alcohol) 65k→120k 1999→2010 → geographic concentration → intergenerational transmission → community capacity erosion (foster care surge, workforce depletion, life expectancy decline) (economic despair creates demand policy cannot address, feedback loop: decline → addiction → more decline)
