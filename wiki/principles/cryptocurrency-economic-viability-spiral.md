# Cryptocurrency Economic Viability Spiral

Bitcoin anonymous payment infrastructure enables ransomware economic model (victim → Bitcoin purchase → ransomware wallet → tumbler/mixer → cash out) → ransom payment rates 40-70% (healthcare 60-70%, government 30-40%, enterprise 50-60%) generate $350M (2020) → $692M (2021) → $1.1B+ (2023) funding gang professionalization → REvil/DarkSide/Conti cartels achieve $100M+ annual revenue → reinvest in attack sophistication (supply chain compromise, double extortion, Ransomware-as-a-Service 70% affiliate revenue split) → more successful attacks in compounding cycle where ransom payments directly fund next-generation attack infrastructure.
