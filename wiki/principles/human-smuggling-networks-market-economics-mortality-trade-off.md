# Human Smuggling Networks Market Economics Mortality Trade Off

Legal pathway collapse → $10-35B/year global smuggling market → Mediterranean $2-5k, US-Mexico $5-15k pricing → route economics mortality 1-3% Mediterranean, 5,096 deaths 2016 peak → cartel monopoly 80%+ control professionalization or increased lethality → enforcement strengthens monopoly (interdiction shifts routes, raises prices, uncertain mortality effect, state facilitation crosses weaponization threshold)
