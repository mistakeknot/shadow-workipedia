# Shelby County Cascade Preclearance Elimination Polling Closure

Shelby County v. Holder (2013) strikes down VRA Section 4(b) → preclearance protection eliminated → same day Texas implements blocked voter ID → 27,000 polling places closed 2012-2022 (116k→89k) → Texas 750 closures → 78 restrictive laws 30 states since 2020 → Shelby County dam breaking event (Supreme Court decision enabled suppression surge, jurisdictions with discrimination histories unrestrained, closures concentrated in minority areas 2×, legal protection→suppression in <24 hours)
