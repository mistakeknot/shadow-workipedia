# Normalization Event Horizon Trust Collapse

Black Sea Ghost Fleet (2023-2024) hundreds of AIS/GNSS tracks jump inland, cargo vessels run aground, insurers deny claims ($10B-$20B annually, 200+ incidents/year) → Iran Persian Gulf spoofing 100+ times → Newark Airport jamming → Moscow Kremlin spoofing bubble → first incident outrage/investigation/deterrence rhetoric, second "again? need better defenses", third "not surprising, cost of doing business", fourth+ "expected background noise" → tipping point after 5-10 major incidents spoofing becomes normalized → GPS treated as unreliable by default, operators add costly backups or exit market (aviation bans autonomy, shipping adds human navigators costs spike, autonomous vehicles dead) → attribution 30-70% confidence typical (technically could be anyone, Russia suspected but deniable) prevents retaliation → normalization doom loop where weak attribution → no retaliation → attacker emboldened → more spoofing → further normalization creating irreversible trust collapse where once GPS credibility gone cannot restore it (trust asymmetry: takes decades to build, destroyed overnight).
