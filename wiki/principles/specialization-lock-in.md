# Specialization Lock In

Comparative advantage specialization over 10-20 years creates 15-25% cost-incumbent advantage through learning curves and supply chain clustering, but once locked into commodity/mineral extraction (Malaysia tin, Zambia copper), reallocation costs of 30-50% of sector output makes diversification economically irreversible, leaving countries vulnerable to 50% GDP volatility in terms-of-trade shocks while diversified economies (South Korea, Singapore) experience 5-10% volatility
