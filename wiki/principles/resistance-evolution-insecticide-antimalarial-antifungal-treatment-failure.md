# Resistance Evolution Insecticide Antimalarial Antifungal Treatment Failure

Simultaneous resistance evolution across all intervention categories where insecticide resistance (pyrethroids globally failing), antimalarial resistance (chloroquine collapsed, artemisinin partial resistance emerging), antifungal resistance (agricultural fungicide selection drives medical treatment failure), diagnostic delays (new endemic areas lack expertise), creating impossible trilemma where vector control fails, drug treatment fails, and prevention fails, ensuring expansion continues without effective countermeasures.
