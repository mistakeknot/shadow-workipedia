# Geographic Concentration Supply Chain Vulnerability Geopolitical Leverage

Critical mineral reserves concentrate in few nations creating supply vulnerability where Congo produces 70% cobalt, China controls 60% rare earths (90% processing), Chile 52% lithium, Indonesia 37% nickel, establishing geopolitical leverage as resource nationalism (nationalization, export restrictions, political conditionality) enables producer states to extract concessions from consuming nations (technology transfers, diplomatic support, debt relief), where China rare earth export quotas 2010 demonstrated supply weapon potential causing prices spike 10× triggering Japan/US panic and resource-securing diplomacy establishing permanent strategic competition over mineral access.
