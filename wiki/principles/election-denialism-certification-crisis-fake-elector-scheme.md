January 6 2021 culmination → months delegitimization rhetoric → fake elector schemes 7 states → VP pressured to exceed constitutional role → post-event: 35 identified rogue election officials refuse certification → 30+ county certification denials/delays since 2020 → 317,886 voter challenges filed 2024 (True the Vote) → bombing threats evacuate 31 polling stations (denialism normalized, certification no longer routine, violence threatened, democratic transfer of power contested)
