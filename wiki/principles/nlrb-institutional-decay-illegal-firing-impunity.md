# NLRB Institutional Decay Illegal Firing Impunity

NLRB case resolution timeline petition → hearing 3-6mo → decision 6-12mo → appeals 1-3 years = 4 years average delays combined with weak penalties ($5k-50k typical << $50k-100k union wage premium cost over 5 years) enable illegal firings 10k-30k/year (20% of organizers in campaigns) with impunity → reinstatement probability 60% offer after 4 years but only 20% workers accept due to backpay delay/hostility → chilling effect multiplier (1 illegal firing deters 10-20 other potential organizers) → budget trajectory $283M (2014) → $274M (2023) inflation-adjusted -20% → Board composition politicization (3-2 majority flips with administration) creating doom loop where under-resourced agency → longer delays → workers stop filing → agency loses constituency → budget cuts deepen → delays worsen further where timeline exceeding 5 years triggers institutional death spiral (workers lose faith, organizing becomes impossible without external catalysts like general strikes).
