# Climate Extreme Weather Amplification Compound Stress

Heat waves surge demand +5-8% per 1°C above normal while stressing aged transformers (rated 40°C, fail 50°C+), hurricanes cause $50B+/year grid damage (6-12 month restoration), wildfires force preemptive shutoffs (California PSPS 2.5M people 2019), and winter storms expose cold-vulnerability gaps (Texas 2021: 4.5M people, 246 deaths, $130B damage), creating weather-related outage increases +67% (2000-2020) that consume emergency repair budgets and prevent planned replacements via maintenance debt spiral.
