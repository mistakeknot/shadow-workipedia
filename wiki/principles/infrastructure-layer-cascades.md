# Infrastructure Layer Cascades

Deplatforming cascades through infrastructure layers—social media bans lead to payment processor bans, then hosting providers (Cloudflare), then DNS registrars, then domain seizure. Each layer is harder to replace and more permanent. Parler's 2021 cascade from app stores → AWS → domain registrar demonstrates the full stack vulnerability.
