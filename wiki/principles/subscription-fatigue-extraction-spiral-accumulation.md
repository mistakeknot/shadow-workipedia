# Subscription Fatigue Extraction Spiral Accumulation

Average household $200-400/month across 12-15 subscriptions → 3-5%/year creep → $9.99 → $12.99 → $15.99 normalization → "subscription audit" reveals 30%+ forgotten/unused → cancellation dark patterns (8+ clicks, phone calls required) → 40% fail to cancel → recurring revenue addiction transforms all industries → ownership impossible.
