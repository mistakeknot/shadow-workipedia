# Actor Population Exponential Capability Democratization

Capable actor populations grow by AI access level: nation-states +1.5/year (20→50), sophisticated groups +15/year when commercial/open-source (50→500), radicalized individuals +200/year when open-source + uplift >10x (0→5000), chaos agents +5/year when uplift >50x (0→100) → actor population explosion when knowledge democratization crosses threshold (2030-2040) → ungovernable when actor count exceeds monitoring capacity.
