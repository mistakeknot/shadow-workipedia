# Bloc Clustering Censorship Export

Internet fragments into 4-5 blocs (US-aligned 1.5B declining to 1.2B, China-aligned 2B growing to 2.5B, EU-aligned 500M to 600M, Sovereign states 1.5B to 2B population 2023-2040) with authoritarian regimes exporting surveillance technology (Huawei Safe City $100M-$1B packages, Russia SORM, Belt & Road $50B-$100B digital infrastructure) creating dependency and democratic backsliding cascade (0.50-0.70 adoption probability, <0.20 reversal probability once built).
