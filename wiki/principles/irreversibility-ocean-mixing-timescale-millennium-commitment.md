# Irreversibility Ocean Mixing Timescale Millennium Commitment

Ocean mixing timescales (surface→deep 100-1000 years, full equilibration 10,000 years) make acidification effectively irreversible on civilization timescales where pH recovery requires both emissions cessation AND millennium-scale oceanic circulation to sequester excess CO2, creating multi-century commitment to ecosystem collapse even under aggressive mitigation (pH 7.8 crossed 2050 persists until 2500-3000), while 20-million-year geological stability at pH 8.2 emphasizes unprecedented 100× faster acidification rate vs any event except Permian-Triassic extinction.
