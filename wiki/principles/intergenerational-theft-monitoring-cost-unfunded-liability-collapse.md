# Intergenerational Theft Monitoring Cost Unfunded Liability Collapse

40 years electricity generation ($100B-$500B revenue) imposes 10,000-year monitoring/security burden on 400+ future generations ($10M+/year per site = $1T+ cumulative) who receive zero electricity benefit but inherit full costs plus contamination consequences, creating unsustainable economic structure where monitoring cessation becomes inevitable during government collapse/economic crisis/war, triggering repository failure → groundwater contamination → exclusion zones → radiation poisoning across centuries as ultimate realized intergenerational crime.
