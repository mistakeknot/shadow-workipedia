# Urbanization Acceleration Megacity Growth Governance Capacity Mismatch

Urban population reaches 68% global (2050) from 56% (2020) adding 2.5B urban residents while megacities (10M+ population) grow from 33 (2018) to 50+ (2040) with largest reaching 50-70M (Lagos, Kinshasa, Dhaka), where urban growth rate 2-4% annually exceeds infrastructure investment 0.5-1.5% creating governance capacity deficit as municipal budgets $200-500 per capita cannot provide services requiring $2,000-5,000 per capita (water, sanitation, security, healthcare) establishing megacity ungovernability threshold when population exceeds administrative capacity by 5-10× ensuring permanent underservice for billions.
