# Tier Concentration Fragility

Supply chains consolidated to "mother factories" where single facilities produce 50-90% of critical components—TSMC for advanced chips (90%), single Japanese resin plants for automotive coatings, Korean battery separator factories for EVs—creating geographic concentration where one fire, flood, or cyberattack halts global production.
