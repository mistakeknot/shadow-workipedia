# Cooling Center Refugee Model Inadequate Capacity Dignity Loss

Cooling centers 20-50 mile gaps in rural areas → 8AM-8PM hours miss overnight danger → shelters require ID, exclude homeless → dignity stripped (public sleeping, no privacy) → pet exclusions force impossible choices → capacity 100-500 when need is 10,000+ → triage during crisis.
