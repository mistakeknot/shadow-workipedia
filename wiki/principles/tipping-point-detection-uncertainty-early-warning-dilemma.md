# Tipping Point Detection Uncertainty Early Warning Dilemma

AMOC monitoring infrastructure satellite missions (sea surface temperature/salinity), mooring arrays (RAPID 26°N continuous measurements), tracer measurements (radiocarbon/chlorofluorocarbons), proxy reconstruction (sediment cores 1850-present calibration) provides tipping probability estimates with uncertainty bounds ±10% (high-investment $5B-$10B science budgets) vs ±30% (low-investment <$1B budgets) creating early warning challenge where 2024-2030 gradual weakening (17 Sv → 12 Sv) shows warning signs (cooling blob south of Greenland, salinity anomalies) but tipping probability uncertain (20-50% range) forcing player decision invest massive prevention/adaptation costs ($100B-$500B geoengineering Arctic aerosols/AMOC artificial mixing/early European retrofits) based on probabilistic forecast vs wait-and-see risk missing intervention window (tipping point 2035-2050 sudden collapse 5-10 years insufficient adaptation time) where false positive costs (premature investment wasted if collapse averted) vs false negative costs (delayed response millions die if collapse occurs) and monitoring investment creates moral hazard where better detection capability (uncertainty ±10%) enables earlier intervention (2030 vs 2040) potentially averting collapse but requires upfront science funding commitment ($5B-$10B) that competes with immediate development priorities creating Cassandra dilemma where scientists warn policymakers ignore until too late (precedent COVID-19 pandemic preparedness underfunding).
