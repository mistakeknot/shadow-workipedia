# Options Leverage Concentration Lottery Ticket Mentality

Weekly options ("0DTE" zero-days-to-expiry) = 100× leverage + 90%+ expire worthless → retail options volume 40%+ of total (vs 25% 2019) → single-stock concentration (TSLA AAPL NVDA GME AMC top 10 = 60%+ retail flow) → lottery ticket psychology: small stake + unlikely win + social proof = rational for entertainment, catastrophic for wealth building → average retail options trader loses $1,800/year (Robinhood data) → "let it ride" mentality compounds losses → margin calls trigger forced liquidation cascades.
