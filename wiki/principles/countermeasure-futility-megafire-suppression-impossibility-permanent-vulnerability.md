# Countermeasure Futility Megafire Suppression Impossibility Permanent Vulnerability

Fire suppression against 100,000+ kW/m megafires requires 10-100× normal resources (water bombers, firebreaks, retardant) but pyroCb-generating fires spread 5-15 km/hour creating 100,000+ km² burn areas within 48-72 hours overwhelming all suppression capacity, while pre-ignition forest thinning ($500-2,000/hectare) becomes economically impossible at continental scale ($trillions for Russia/Canada/Australia forests), ensuring permanent vulnerability where defensive investment always insufficient against $10,000-100,000 drone swarm ignition operations.
