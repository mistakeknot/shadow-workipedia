# Fisheries Catch Effort Economic Death Spiral

Marine protein production decline (forage fish -40-60% from zooplankton collapse, commercial fish -30-70% cascading from prey loss) triggers fishing effort doubling to compensate, creating death spiral where catch -50% while costs double makes operations economically unviable, government subsidies delay but cannot prevent permanent collapse, and 3.3 billion people lose 20%+ protein intake driving malnutrition and terrestrial protein competition (deforestation for livestock, emissions feedback).
