# Indigenous Territory Demarcation Agribusiness Frontier Conflict

Indigenous territory status determines deforestation rates where demarcated territories (13% Amazon, 0.1-0.3%/year deforestation) vs claimed-but-undemarcated (8%, invasion rate 2-5%/year) vs unprotected (79%, deforestation 2-8%/year accessibility-dependent) but demarcation process requires 5-15 years per territory plus political will (Approval Index 0.0-1.0) encountering agribusiness pressure where soy price ($300-$600/ton each +$100 → +15-25% deforestation pressure), beef price ($2-$5/kg each +$1 → +10-20% deforestation), infrastructure (roads/ports opening new frontier zones) drive land speculation dynamics (deforest establish "use" claim, flip land 10-50× ROI) and political capture where agribusiness lobby (Bancada Ruralista Brazilian Congress) blocks demarcation legislation, weakens enforcement budgets creating historical volatility 1988-2004 deforestation peak 20,000-28,000 km²/year → 2004-2012 decline 4,600 km²/year (enforcement + soy moratorium) → 2013-2018 creep 7,500 km²/year → 2019-2022 Bolsonaro surge 13,000 km²/year → 2023-2025 Lula decline 9,000 km²/year (target 0 by 2030 politically unachievable given agribusiness veto power) demonstrating governance oscillation preventing sustained protection.
