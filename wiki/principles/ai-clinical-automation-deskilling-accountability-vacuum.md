# AI Clinical Automation Deskilling Accountability Vacuum

AI triage adoption without validation → model drift causes mass misdiagnosis → demographic bias encodes disparities → automation bias (humans defer to wrong AI) → black box opacity → liability vacuum (no one responsible when algorithms kill) → physician skill atrophy → cannot override wrong AI → patients die when AI fails + doctors incompetent (AI accuracy degrades post-deployment, bias amplifies inequities, accountability impossible, competence vs confidence divergence)
