# Attribution Fog Of War Ignition Pattern Legal Threshold Gap

Satellite forensics detect ignition points (±100m precision) along suspicious linear patterns perpendicular to wind achieving 68-82% confidence for intentional arson, but legal retaliation threshold requires 95% certainty creating exploitable gap where 75-85% public belief triggers diplomatic crises and domestic war pressure insufficient for justified military response, enabling plausibly deniable pyroCb strikes as climate warfare shadow war where nations burn each other's territories while maintaining diplomatic deniability.
