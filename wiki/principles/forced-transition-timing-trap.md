# Forced Transition Timing Trap

Gradual 30-year transition avoids stranded asset collapse but enables climate catastrophe >2.5°C requiring emergency forced transition 2040-2060 that creates chaotic industry collapse impossible to manage with just transition, while rapid 10-year transition prevents climate damage but guarantees financial crisis + worker displacement + petro-state collapse simultaneously, creating no-win timing dilemma where all paths produce catastrophic outcomes at different scales
