# Resource Nationalism Supply Disruption Green Transition Constraint

Producer nations increasingly assert resource sovereignty through nationalization (Chile lithium nationalization 2023, Indonesia nickel export ban 2020 forcing domestic processing, Congo renegotiating mining contracts demanding 70% state ownership) and forming mineral cartels (lithium triangle Argentina-Chile-Bolivia coordination analogous to OPEC), where supply disruptions from political instability (coup risks Congo/Bolivia, conflict zones Sahel rare earths) or strategic withholding create green transition constraints as EV production halted by cobalt shortage or renewable deployment limited by rare earth scarcity establishing producer leverage over consumer nations comparable to historical oil dependency.
