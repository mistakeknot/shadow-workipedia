# Prescriber Desert Medication Shortage Access Collapse

60% US counties have zero psychiatrists creating prescriber deserts, therapy waitlists stretch 3-12 months with $100-$250/session costs, while generic psychiatric medication shortages (SSRIs, benzos, antipsychotics from China/India manufacturing concentration) force therapeutic disruption switches and cold-turkey discontinuation withdrawal, leaving treatment gaps at 50-70% for severe illness when demand spikes.
