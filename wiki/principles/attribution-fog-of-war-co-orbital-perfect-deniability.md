# Attribution Fog Of War Co Orbital Perfect Deniability

Attribution confidence natural collision vs intentional ASAT achieves only 40-60% from debris forensics and orbital tracking, dropping to 0-20% for co-orbital "inspection" satellites approaching within meters (2024 Chinese demo) enabling EMP/laser disable without debris creation (untraceable), creating exploitable gray zone where 70-85% confidence insufficient for Article 5 retaliation threshold 95% allowing satellites destroyed with perfect plausible deniability as attribution gap prevents collective defense trigger.
