# Death Row Attrition Delay Paradox

Death row population 3,500 peak (1995) → 2,400 (2022) via attrition where only 10% actually executed while 15% die naturally (average 20+ years on row, age 45 → 65+), 4% exonerated, 5% commuted, 66% retrials/resentencing → execution delay paradox creates "death by incarceration" where condemned spend decades in solitary → cruel and unusual punishment arguments → litigation → further delays → vicious cycle undermining death penalty's retributive purpose while costing $1.26M premium per case (vs life imprisonment) driving fiscal conservative defection to abolition coalition.
