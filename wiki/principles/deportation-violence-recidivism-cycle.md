# Deportation Violence Recidivism Cycle

Deportations to violence-ridden countries (10-15% deported to homicide >50 per 100k like El Salvador, Honduras) create mortality risk (some killed within months) → survivors face economic desperation (no jobs, gang extortion, family ties in US) → re-entry probability 30-40% within 1 year → repeat detention ($12,500/deportation wasted) → escalating danger each cycle → deportation bus ambush scenario (militia attacks ICE transport, 3 agents killed, 20 escapees) creates manhunt + vigilante killings → "dangerous illegals on loose" narrative drives further enforcement → when deportations exceed 300k/year AND recidivism remains >30% the cycle becomes permanent human rights crisis generating continuous violence both in deporting nation and receiving countries.
