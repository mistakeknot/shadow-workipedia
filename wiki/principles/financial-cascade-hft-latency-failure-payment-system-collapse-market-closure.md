# Financial Cascade HFT Latency Failure Payment System Collapse Market Closure

Financial markets depend on <10ms latency where 10-30% cable capacity loss spikes latency from 5ms to 50-200ms causing HFT algorithm failures and market volatility +50-200%, while 30-50% loss degrades payment systems (SWIFT delays from seconds to minutes/hours) triggering $5-10B/day transaction failures, and 50-90% loss closes markets entirely ($10 trillion/day transactions halted) triggering ATM international failures and bank runs within 48-72 hours as credit card cross-border transactions fail 20-50%, demonstrating nonlinear failure cascade where minor degradation tolerable but threshold crossing triggers civilization-threatening collapse.
