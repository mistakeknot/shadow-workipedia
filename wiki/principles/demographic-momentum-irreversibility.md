# Demographic Momentum Irreversibility

Total fertility rate (TFR) decline from 6.0 to 1.5 over development trajectory creates 20-30 year commitment where even immediate TFR restoration to 2.1 cannot prevent working-age population peak followed by 30-50 year decline, visible in Japan (peaked 1995 at 87.8M, now 125M declining 0.6%/year projected to 100M by 2070) and South Korea (TFR 0.72 in 2023, guaranteed 20% population loss over next 40 years regardless of policy interventions)
