# Diabetes Epidemic Healthcare Overwhelm

Obesity 42% adults 2024 → prediabetes 38% → Type 2 diabetes 11.5%→20% 2050 → complication cascades (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, cardiovascular) → primary care capacity exhausted → endocrinology shortage → healthcare cost $173B→$500B+ (diabetes epidemic consumes medical system, complications multiply, treatment capacity insufficient, prevention ignored)
