# Reinsurance Capacity Exhaustion Systemic Risk

Global reinsurance market $650B annual capacity faces concentration risk when major hurricane + wildfire season occur simultaneously (precedent: Hurricane Andrew 1992 exhausted 10-15% capacity) → climate amplification drives $200B-$300B+ loss events (vs historical $125B Katrina maximum) → reinsurance exhaustion triggers primary insurer bankruptcy waves → government backstops absorb systemic risk but lack capital reserves → sovereign debt crisis (state/federal bailouts $50B-$200B) → fiscal capacity limits force benefit cuts + premium surcharges +100-300% → middle-class exodus from insurance programs → coverage collapse even in moderate-risk zones.
