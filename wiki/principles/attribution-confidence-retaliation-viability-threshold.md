# Attribution Confidence Retaliation Viability Threshold

Attribution accuracy 0.50→0.80 over 2010-2025 → false flag probability 15% baseline confuses forensics → confidence threshold by doctrine: 0.60 (Aggressive Offensive retaliate early), 0.75 (Defensive Deterrence proportional response), 0.85 (Treaty Regime multilateral verification) → below threshold: attacks unanswered (attacker emboldening) or require cooperative investigation → technology race: better attribution (+0.05/year) → obfuscation response (+0.08/year) → equilibrium 70-80%.
