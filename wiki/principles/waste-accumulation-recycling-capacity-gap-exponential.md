# Waste Accumulation Recycling Capacity Gap Exponential

500,000 tons battery waste (2020) → 11 million tons/year by 2030 (22× increase) → recycling capacity ~200,000 tons/year (<5% of projected need) → EV sales 14M (2023) → 40M+ by 2030 → grid storage 16GW (2023) → 400+ GW by 2030 → battery lifespan 8-15 years EV, 10-20 grid → first wave of mass EV adoption batteries reaching end-of-life 2028-2035 → recycling infrastructure 10× behind (transition speed creates waste bomb, infrastructure cannot catch up)
