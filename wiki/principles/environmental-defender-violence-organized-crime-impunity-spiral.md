# Environmental Defender Violence Organized Crime Impunity Spiral

Illegal logging/mining/ranching operations protected by organized crime networks produce environmental defender killings 150-300+/year (activists, indigenous leaders, government inspectors) with impunity rate 90-95% (investigations stalled, witnesses intimidated, prosecutors threatened) creating chilling effect where NGO capacity degrades (staff turnover, trauma, funding withdrawal) and violence escalation ladder: surveillance → intimidation → death threats → assassination (typical 6-18 month progression) enabling business model where criminal networks capture $10B-$50B/year illegal resource extraction (timber, gold, cattle on protected lands) compared to $1M-$5M annual enforcement budget creating economic asymmetry 10,000× to 50,000× favoring crime and organized crime state capture where local police/politicians bribed/threatened preventing investigation producing permanent impunity where 2004-2012 enforcement surge (Lula I/II administrations) achieved killings reduction 300 → 150/year but 2019-2022 Bolsonaro encouraged violence (rhetoric "open for business", enforcement budget cuts -40%) producing surge 150 → 300+/year demonstrating fragility of rule-of-law where political transitions reverse progress creating oscillation preventing sustained deterrence.
