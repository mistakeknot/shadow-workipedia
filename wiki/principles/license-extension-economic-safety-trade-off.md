# License Extension Economic Safety Trade Off

Nuclear reactor economics require 60-80 year operation to amortize $10B-20B construction costs → electricity prices $30-50/MWh but new nuclear $100-150/MWh (Vogtle, Hinkley Point C) makes replacement uneconomical → renewable alternatives (solar $20-30/MWh, wind $25-40/MWh, battery $50-70/MWh) erode nuclear competitiveness → when existing reactor generates $500M-1B/year revenue (1,000 MW × $30-50/MWh × 7,000 hours baseload) but replacement costs $10B-20B = 10-20 year payback impossible → utilities lobby for 80-100 year license extensions despite exponentially increasing failure probability (age 60-80 years doubles failure risk every 10 years) → regulator capture (NRC 99% approval rate, industry-funded budget 90%, revolving door employment) rubber-stamps extensions creating systemic risk where economic survival incentives override safety considerations and fleet-wide aging cascade becomes inevitable.
