# Damage Multiplier Cascade Economics

$1 stolen copper = $100-1,000 replacement/repair costs → substation theft $50k-$500k in copper causes $1-10M grid damage → single substation affects 50,000-500,000 people → restoration 6hr (distribution) to 6+ months (major substation) → transformer lead time 12-24 months → theft economics work precisely because damage far exceeds theft value (privatized gains, socialized destruction)
