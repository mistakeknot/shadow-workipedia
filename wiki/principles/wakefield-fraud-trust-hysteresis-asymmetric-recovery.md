# Wakefield Fraud Trust Hysteresis Asymmetric Recovery

1998 Lancet fraud (MMR-autism, retracted 2010) → UK MMR coverage 92%→73% (50% London) → correction reaches 10% of misinformation audience → backfire effects strengthen beliefs → community memory preserves fraud 25+ years → trust erodes 3-5× faster than rebuilds (single fraudulent study creates permanent anti-vaccine movement, retractions ineffective, trust depletion with hysteresis, cannot rebuild at erosion speed)
