# Irreversible Compaction Subsidence

Aquifer depletion exceeding virgin compression stress creates permanent land subsidence through clay layer compaction (Central Valley 28ft 1925-1977, +13ft 2007-2015 drought) with storage capacity lost forever, while contamination concentration (arsenic, uranium) makes aquifer permanently unusable even if recharged as lower volumes mobilize toxins and reduce dilution capacity.
