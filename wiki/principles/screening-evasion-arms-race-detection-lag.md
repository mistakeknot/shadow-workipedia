# Screening Evasion Arms Race Detection Lag

DNA synthesis screening detection rate degrades 70% (2020) → 50% (2030) → 20% (2040) as AI-optimized evasion techniques (sequence obfuscation -30%, fragmentation -50%, natural mimicry -40%) outpace detection algorithms → generation gap penalty -15% detection per AI generation ahead → benchtop synthesizers (2035+) provide complete screening bypass (0% detection) → arms race structurally favors evasion because screening requires full coverage while evasion needs single gap.
