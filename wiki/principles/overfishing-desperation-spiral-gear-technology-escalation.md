# Overfishing Desperation Spiral Gear Technology Escalation

Protein dependency drives fishing intensification as catches decline creating death spiral where gillnets→electric fishing→poison→explosives escalate in desperation, Mekong 2.6M tons/year catch declining 40-80% while 60M people depend on fish for 80% animal protein, effort doubling/tripling as populations crash, subsistence fishers forced into destructive methods destroying juvenile/breeding populations ensuring permanent collapse.
