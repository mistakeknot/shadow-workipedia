# Debt Accumulation Unsustainability GDP Ratio Exponential Growth

Global debt reaches 256% GDP (2020) from 200% (2008) with sovereign debt 88% GDP, corporate 92%, household 76%, growing 3-5%/year while GDP grows 2-3%/year creating mathematical impossibility as debt service exceeds new borrowing capacity when interest rates >3% (2024-2025 baseline) triggering either coordinated default or austerity depression, where 60+ nations exceed 90% debt-to-GDP threshold (historical default zone) and 20+ nations exceed 150% ensuring cascade probability 20-40% by 2030.
