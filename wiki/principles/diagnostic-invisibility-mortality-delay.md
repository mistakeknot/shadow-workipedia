# Diagnostic Invisibility Mortality Delay

Fungal infections mimic bacterial sepsis, tuberculosis, and cancer. Blood cultures miss 50%+ of invasive candidiasis. Many patients die without diagnosis, undercount compounds underfunding, and delayed treatment multiplies mortality (>50% for invasive aspergillosis if therapy starts >24 hours late).
