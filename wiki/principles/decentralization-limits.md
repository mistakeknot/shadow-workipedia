# Decentralization Limits

Alternative platforms (Gab, Parler, Rumble) face the same infrastructure dependencies—they still need payment processors, app stores, cloud hosting, and DNS. True decentralization (cryptocurrency, IPFS, Tor) imposes 100× friction that limits adoption to technical minorities, creating a "freedom tax" that excludes most users.
