# Governance Vacuum No Regulation No Measurement No Enforcement

No international treaty on light pollution (unlike air, water, noise) → national regulations rare (France 2018 limited, Slovenia 2007) → municipal dark sky ordinances exist (500+ US) but weakly enforced → no standardized measurement (lumens? lux? color temperature? skyglow?) → satellite monitoring emerging but not regulatory → lighting industry lobbying against restrictions → dark sky preserves (100+ IDA certified) but shrinking.
