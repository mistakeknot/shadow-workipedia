# Chargemaster Pricing Opacity Extraction Maximization

Hospital chargemaster 3-20× actual cost + hidden until 2021 + Tylenol $15-37 (cost $0.02) → no market discipline → prices unlimited → 66% bankruptcies medical-linked → 530,000 bankruptcies annually + 100M Americans with medical debt $195B outstanding (system designed to extract maximum revenue from captive patients, not pricing failure but pricing success)
