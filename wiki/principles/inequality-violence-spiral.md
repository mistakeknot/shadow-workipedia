# Inequality Violence Spiral

Latin America's extreme inequality (Gini 0.45-0.55) creates permanent social conflict, with murder rates correlating strongly with inequality indices—region has 8% of world population but 33% of homicides, measured by homicide rate per 100k (regional average ~20, vs. global 6), inequality-violence correlation (r=0.68), and gang territorial control in urban informal settlements.
