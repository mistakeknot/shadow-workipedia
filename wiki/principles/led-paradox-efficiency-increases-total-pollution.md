# LED Paradox Efficiency Increases Total Pollution

LED 80% more energy-efficient than incandescent → predicted energy savings not realized → "rebound effect": cheaper light = more light installed → LED adoption 2010-2025 increased total lumens 50-100% → blue-rich LEDs (4000K+) 2-3× more disruptive than warm alternatives → municipalities chose efficiency over spectrum → retrofit programs locked in 20+ year infrastructure → "better light" campaigns ignore ecological/health harms.
