# Programmable Money Conditional Spending Totalitarian Control

CBDC programmability enables conditional spending restrictions where money expires (demurrage to force consumption), restricts purchases (carbon credits limit travel/meat, alcohol prohibition enforcement, gambling blocks), or targets recipients (welfare payments valid only for approved goods, sanctions automatically enforced at transaction level), as China digital yuan pilots demonstrate geographic/temporal restrictions and spending category controls, creating totalitarian money where government approval required for each transaction enabling perfect policy enforcement (negative interest rates inescapable, wealth taxes automatically deducted, capital controls physically impossible to evade) surpassing all historical financial control mechanisms.
