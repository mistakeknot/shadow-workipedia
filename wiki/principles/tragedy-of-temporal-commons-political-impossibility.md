# Tragedy Of Temporal Commons Political Impossibility

$290B hardening investment (5 tiers: $10B early warning, $100B GIC blockers, $30B transformer reserves, $50B satellite hardening, $100B grid resilience) prevents $10-12T catastrophe = 41× ROI if storm hits BUT 1% annual probability (26% over 30 years) systematically underweighted by voters/politicians → political horizon 2-4 years << 30-year risk window → rational political calculus: if NO storm during term approval rating -30% ("wasted $290B on nothing"), if storm hits NEXT administration they get credit for preparedness you get blame for deficit → optimal political strategy gamble on 99% no-storm probability delay spending vs optimal societal strategy invest now → when all actors face same incentives nobody invests creating coordination failure where individually rational decisions (delay spending) produce collectively catastrophic outcome (21-year recovery, 1.5M deaths, 56% government collapse) demonstrating how electoral cycles structurally prevent long-timeline risk mitigation.
