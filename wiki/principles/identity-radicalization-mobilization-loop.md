# Identity Radicalization Mobilization Loop

Male economic decline (declining real wages -1-2% annually for 15-20 years in developed economies, high unemployment 15-25% in disadvantaged regions) coupled with skewed sex ratios from female migration creates marriage market failure affecting 10-20% of cohort, lowering social integration and increasing radicalization vulnerability by 3-5× (incels, extremism), which catalyzes police crackdowns → viral video catalysis → protest escalation → counter-movement mobilization, generating cultural fragmentation where trust in institutions declines 20-40 points over 5-10 years, visible in post-industrial regions (Rust Belt, post-deindustrialization Europe) experiencing simultaneous authoritarianism surges and 30-50% migration outflows
