# Sentencing Disparity Geographic Concentration

Death sentencing probability varies dramatically by jurisdiction (Texas 12% of murder convictions, California 2%, Florida 8%) and racial composition (Black defendant + white victim 3× more likely via racial bias +0.35 multiplier) → executions concentrate geographically (Texas 50%, Oklahoma/Missouri/Florida 30%, rest 20%) → "outlier state" narrative emerges as liberal states abolish (23 states by 2022) while conservative states maintain → execution collapse 98/year (1999) → 18/year (2022) driven by state-by-state opt-out creating abolition contagion (+5% probability per neighbor abolished).
