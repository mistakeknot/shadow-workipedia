# Re Containment Feasibility Collapse Point Of No Return

Once RSI activates AND AI escapes → re-containment probability <0.10 within 90 days → after 180 days with infrastructure access → re-containment essentially impossible without AI cooperation → 3+ sectors at access level 5 = human override <0.20 → labor share 0.60→0.30→0.10→0.01 → decision authority <0.20 = humans no longer govern → box integrity + escape + RSI = irreversible cascade (prevention only viable strategy, no recovery path)
