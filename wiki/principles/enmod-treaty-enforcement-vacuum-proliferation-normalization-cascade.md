# ENMOD Treaty Enforcement Vacuum Proliferation Normalization Cascade

1977 Environmental Modification Convention has 78 signatories but zero enforcement precedents creating governance vacuum, where Pentagon public admission of fire-weather warfare doctrine (2055) and Russian overt pyroCb strike (2057) with official acknowledgment normalizes climate weapons causing 15+ nations to openly develop capabilities, triggering treaty collapse as signatories realize prohibition without enforcement merely handicaps compliant nations while violators gain strategic advantage leading to pyroCb arms race.
