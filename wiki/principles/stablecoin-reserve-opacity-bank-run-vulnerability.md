# Stablecoin Reserve Opacity Bank Run Vulnerability

Stablecoins claim 1:1 USD backing but reserve composition opaque → Tether (USDT, $83B) holds commercial paper, secured loans, corporate bonds, NOT 100% cash → reserve quality degrades during growth (easy inflows) but exposed during stress (redemption pressure) → bank run dynamics: doubt → redemptions → forced selling → depeg → panic → death spiral → UST/LUNA ($40B → $0 in 72 hours) proved stablecoins can collapse faster than traditional banks → no FDIC, no lender of last resort, no circuit breakers.
