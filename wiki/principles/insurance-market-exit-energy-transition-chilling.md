# Insurance Market Exit Energy Transition Chilling

Grid storage insurance premiums +200-500% → some insurers exiting market entirely → APS McMicken fire $6M+ cleanup + criminal investigation → grid storage setback requirements increasing 10ft → 100+ ft → without insurance mortgages unavailable → major fire → insurance tightens/exits → grid storage investment chills → energy transition slows → continued fossil fuel use → climate pressure → more batteries deployed anyway (insurance feedback can stall transition, but climate pressure forces continued deployment)
