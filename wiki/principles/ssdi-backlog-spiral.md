# SSDI Backlog Spiral

Long COVID prevalence drives SSDI filing surge (baseline 1M/year → 1.8-2.5M/year peak) overwhelming processing capacity (1-2M cases/year budget-constrained) → backlog accumulation creates wait time explosion (6 months baseline → 18-24 months peak) → household income collapse during waiting period (savings depletion → poverty → homelessness at 12-18 month runway) → eligibility determination battles where Long COVID "invisible illness" achieves only 30-50% initial approval (vs 65% traditional disabilities) → 60% appeal rate with 12-18 month additional wait → 40% ultimate approval → financial desperation feedback loop forcing shadow economy entry.
