# Space Access Monopoly Lock In

Only nations with heavy-lift launch capability can deploy SBSP, concentrating power among space powers and creating permanent dependency for importers—measured by launch-capable nation count (currently 3-5 for relevant scale), deployment cost barriers ($10-50B per GW initially), and catch-up timeline (decades).
