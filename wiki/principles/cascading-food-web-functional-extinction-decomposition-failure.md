# Cascading Food Web Functional Extinction Decomposition Failure

Insect base collapse cascades through ecosystem as insectivores starve (birds -2.9B, bats crashing, amphibians collapsing), decomposition services fail (nutrient cycling breakdown, organic matter accumulation), and pest explosion paradox emerges where natural predator elimination causes outbreaks despite pesticide escalation, driving functional extinction threshold crossing where specialist species disappear, generalists dominate, functional redundancy lost, and ecosystems simplified to pest-resistant monocultures in Silent Spring endpoint where no birds sing, no bees hum, no butterflies dance.
