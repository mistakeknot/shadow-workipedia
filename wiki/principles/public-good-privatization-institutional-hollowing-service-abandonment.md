# Public Good Privatization Institutional Hollowing Service Abandonment

Public institutions hollow out as funding declines (education -15% real per student 2010-2025, libraries -25%, parks -20%) while service expectations increase, forcing privatization where 40-60% university budgets from tuition vs 20-30% historical, public schools supplemented by parent donations creating two-tier access (wealthy neighborhoods $500-2,000 per student private contributions vs poor $0-50), establishing public good abandonment where functional services available only through private payment delegitimizing public institutions as vehicles for collective provision.
