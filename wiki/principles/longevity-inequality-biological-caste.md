# Longevity Inequality Biological Caste

Rich access life extension (120-150+ years by 2060) vs poor die at 60-70 → gerontocracy power concentration (150-year senators never retire) → inheritance crisis (children die before parents) → anti-immortality movements → clinic violence → two-species divergence (differential access creates permanent biological castes, lifespan gap >50 years by 2080)
