# Cognitive Impairment Safety Collapse

Brain fog prevalence (65% of Long COVID patients) interacts with safety-critical job requirements creating accident probability explosion → transit operators experience +150% baseline accident rate (0.5 → 1.25 per 100K hours), industrial workers +200% (2.0 → 6.0 per 100K hours) from attention/reaction time/executive function deficits → office worker productivity crashes -20-40% with error rates +30-50% → no accommodation mandates + SSDI denial forces continued work while impaired → public incidents (bus crashes, factory accidents, medical errors) trigger media coverage → political battle between accommodation mandates vs "personal responsibility" narratives → legitimacy crisis.
