# Climate Mortality Vulnerability Structure

Age cohort climate mortality (heat waves, wet bulb >35°C, water stress) concentrates 60-80% in elderly (>65) and youngest (<5) populations, creating mortality spikes of 5-50 per 100k in peak heat events (2010 Russian heat wave: 55k excess deaths, 40% >65 years old), while middle-age (25-50) cohorts experience 2-5× lower mortality, generating 3-6 month life expectancy loss per decade of 2°C warming in tropical/subtropical zones, directly reducing workforce and generating 2-3% economic output loss through morbidity
