# Debt Specialization Distortion

Medical students graduating with $250,000-500,000 in debt rationally pursue high-paying specialties (dermatology: $450k+, cardiology: $400k+) over primary care ($220k), creating 2-3x more specialists than needed while primary care faces 50,000+ physician shortages—the market efficiently allocates talent away from public health needs.
