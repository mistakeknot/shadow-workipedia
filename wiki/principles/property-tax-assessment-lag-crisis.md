# Property Tax Assessment Lag Crisis

CRE valuations collapse -30% to -70% (2023-2025) but property tax assessments lag 2-3 years creating delayed fiscal cliff → when assessments adjust (2025-2027) municipal revenue crashes -10% to -30% for CRE-heavy cities (20-40% of tax base downtown-dependent) → structural deficits -5% to -20% of budget → credit rating downgrades (AAA/AA → BBB → junk) → borrowing costs spike +200-500 basis points → state takeover threshold (deficit >5-10% + junk rating) triggers emergency control boards → austerity (layoffs 10-30%, service cuts 20-40%) → population exodus → revenue falls further in doom loop.
