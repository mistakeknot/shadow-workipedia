# Automation Bias Skill Atrophy Feedback

Once clinicians routinely defer to AI recommendations, diagnostic reasoning skills atrophy within 3-5 years. Physicians who override AI face liability exposure when wrong, but AI failures trigger "automation bias" where clinicians accept obviously incorrect recommendations because "the computer said so." Boeing 737 MAX crashes demonstrated identical dynamics—pilots couldn't recognize or correct automation failures.
