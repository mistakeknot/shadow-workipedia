# Care Crisis Triage Abandonment Elderly Disabled Children

Care system reaches triage crisis where demand 2× supply forcing abandonment decisions as families choose which members receive care, where 30-50% elderly lack adequate support (inadequate nutrition, missed medications, fall risks, social isolation), 40-60% disabled adults live in institutional settings vs preferred community integration, and 20-30% low-income children lack quality childcare ensuring developmental delays, creating systematic abandonment affecting 200M+ people globally denied dignified care through system incapacity not individual failure.
