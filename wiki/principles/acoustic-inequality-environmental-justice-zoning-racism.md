# Acoustic Inequality Environmental Justice Zoning Racism

Highway placement through minority/low-income communities → airports, rail yards, industrial zones adjacent to poor neighborhoods → acoustic redlining: property values inversely correlate with noise → wealthy communities have quiet (NIMBY success) → poor communities have no political power for noise barriers → school quality correlates with acoustic environment → health burden concentrated on vulnerable populations → silence as luxury.
