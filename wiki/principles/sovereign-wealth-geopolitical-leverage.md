# Sovereign Wealth Geopolitical Leverage

Strategic desal acquisitions by Saudi PIF, UAE ADQ, Qatar QIA in client states (Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan) create water-based coercion mechanisms where control >30% capacity enables policy influence (base rights, UN votes, Belt & Road alignment) via shutoff threats (Russia gas to Europe precedent: 0.60-0.80 coercion success), making nationalization impossible without BIT arbitration ($5B Argentina precedent) plus geopolitical retaliation (gas cutoffs, sanctions), transforming water infrastructure into sovereignty constraint.
