# Strike Fund Depletion Endurance Race

General strike outcome depends on which side's resources exhaust first → striker endurance limited by wage loss (missed paychecks after 2 weeks create eviction/starvation risk), strike fund capacity ($1M supports 10,000 workers 1 week, $100M supports 1M workers 2 weeks), public sympathy (essential services cutoff turns opinion day 5-10) vs state endurance limited by GDP collapse (-10-15% per week bankrupts businesses, tax revenue evaporates, international credit downgraded), business pressure for resolution (capitulate to demands vs military crackdown), military loyalty (troops fraternize with workers, mutiny risk increases after 2-3 weeks deployment) → historical durations 3 days to 8 weeks (Seattle 5 days voluntarily demobilized, UK 9 days TUC capitulated, Winnipeg 42 days broken by repression, France 1968 15+ days partial victory) → when strike fund depletes before state capitulates workers forced to return creating 60% defeat rate but if state breaks first (business pressure, military mutiny, international isolation) 30% partial victory, 10% total victory (regime change) creating asymmetric endurance race where state has deeper pockets but strikers have legitimacy.
