# Exponential Demand Linear Supply

AI training FLOPs grow 100x every 2-3 years (GPT-2 10^20 → GPT-3 10^23 → GPT-4 10^25 → projected 10^27) requiring GPU clusters scaling 10k → 25k → 100k+ units, while semiconductor supply grows linearly 20-30% per 2-year fab cycle creating structural shortage persisting 2023-2030+ with 6-12 month waitlists and 2-3x secondary market premiums.
