# Market Narrative Divergence

Natural gas fracking drives 60% of 334 coal plant closures (2010-2023) at $2-4/mmBTU undercutting coal economics, but "war on coal" political narrative blames climate policy creating worker radicalization against wrong target, where actual market forces (not regulation) destroy 178k→42k→<10k employment (1985-2020-2040) while Trump "bring coal back" promises fail (-10k jobs 2017-2020) deepening cultural betrayal and blocking rational transition policy
