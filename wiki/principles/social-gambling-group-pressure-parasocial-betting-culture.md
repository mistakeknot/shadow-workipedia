# Social Gambling Group Pressure Parasocial Betting Culture

Gambling content creators (tout culture) 10M+ followers → Discord betting groups → "locks" "guaranteed" picks (statistically impossible) → parasocial relationships with gamblers → sports media gambling-ified (ESPN, FOX Bet) → fantasy sports as gateway → daily fantasy sports (DFS) as "skill game" classification dodge → friend groups normalize betting → not betting = social exclusion → betting as identity → losses hidden from shame → debt spiral before help-seeking.
