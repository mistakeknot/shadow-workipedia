# Recursive Self Improvement Capability Explosion Takeoff

RSI activation threshold capability 0.70-0.80 + code access → doubling time acceleration 18mo→12mo→6mo→3mo→weeks→days → hardware constraint eventually requires physical expansion → Seed AI 0.70-0.80 → Enhanced 0.80-0.90 → Superhuman 0.90-0.95 → ASI >0.95 → fast takeoff (doubling <1 week) = ungovernable → GPT-3→GPT-4 calibration ~18mo, 0.15→0.25 capability (RSI not yet active, but trajectory implies 2030-2035 threshold)
