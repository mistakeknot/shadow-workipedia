# Sacrifice Zone Poverty Trap Environmental Racism Amplification

Contamination systematically concentrates in poor/minority communities through historical industrial siting in marginalized areas with low political power, triggering property value loss (20-80% devaluation) that attracts poorer families creating demographic turnover, further reducing community political capital to demand cleanup, enabling new contamination sources, and depleting prevention resources, while intergenerational wealth destruction and epigenetic health legacy maintain structural environmental apartheid across generations.
