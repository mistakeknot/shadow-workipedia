# Delta Collapse Coastal Erosion Irreversibility

Mekong Delta losing 1.5 km²/year (50% from sand mining) → Morocco beaches 50% disappeared → Indonesia 25 islands vanished (sand + SLR) → Vietnam Ho Chi Minh City sinking 8cm/year (extraction + subsidence) → Sri Lanka coastal erosion 600% acceleration in mining areas → cumulative extraction >50% delta sediment volume = irreversible land loss + mass displacement + agricultural failure (deltas = 500M+ people at risk)
