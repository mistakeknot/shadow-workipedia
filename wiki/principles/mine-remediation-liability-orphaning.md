# Mine Remediation Liability Orphaning

10k+ abandoned mine sites create $10B+ unfunded cleanup liability when coal companies bankruptcy → orphaned sites → federal Superfund (underfunded) → decades of acid mine drainage polluting watersheds → cancer clusters, where industry privatizes profits (1985-2010 boom) but socializes cleanup costs (2020-2060 bust) creating permanent environmental damage that outlasts economic activity and compounds regional despair
