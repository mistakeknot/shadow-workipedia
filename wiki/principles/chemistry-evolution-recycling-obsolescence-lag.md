# Chemistry Evolution Recycling Obsolescence Lag

Battery chemistry improves rapidly → older batteries obsolete faster → replacement accelerates → more waste generated → recycling designed for old chemistry → new batteries harder to recycle → technology improvement → lag → obsolescence loop → second-life battery fire risk in new contexts (home storage, grid backup) → 2028-2035 first wave aging → second-life market collapse potential (chemistry evolution outpaces recycling adaptation, moving target)
