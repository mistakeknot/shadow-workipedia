# Critical Infrastructure Vulnerability Sector Cascade Formula

Power grid SCADA exposure 0.65-0.85 → winter attack casualties = affected × 0.15 vulnerable × 0.001-0.005 mortality × 3.0 seasonal (USA 10M affected = 15k deaths hypothetical) → election systems 0.75 (2016) → 0.55 (2020) post-hardening (-0.30 paper backup) → hospitals 0.80-0.90 (ransomware WannaCry £92M) → nuclear C3I 0.20-0.40 (most hardened) → hardening ROI diminishes after $100B cumulative → political will +30% post-attack then -2%/year decay → saturation when all sectors >0.80 makes defense impossible.
