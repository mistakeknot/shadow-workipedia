# Onshoring Cost Politics Inaction Cycle

Domestic production 2-5× higher cost → $50-100B reshoring investment needed + 5-10yr timeline to build/qualify → COVID wake-up call → $35B promised → minimal delivery (market logic dominates: cost minimization, shareholder returns, quarterly earnings) → bipartisan support, minimal action → strategic stockpile $5-20B establishment + $1B+ annual maintenance (never funded) → next crisis finds same vulnerabilities (efficiency over resilience, profits over security, quarterly returns over lives)
