# Demographic Dependency Ratio Mathematical Collapse

Fertility collapse below replacement (2.1→1.3) combined with life expectancy explosion (65→85+ years) drives dependency ratio deterioration from 4:1 workers-per-retiree to 1.5:1, destroying pay-as-you-go system mathematics where 2.5:1 requires modest benefit cuts, 2:1 requires major reforms, 1.5:1 makes collapse inevitable, and 1:1 (Japan's trajectory 2035) demands complete restructuring as pension costs consume 30%+ GDP and retirement duration doubles beyond actuarial assumptions.
