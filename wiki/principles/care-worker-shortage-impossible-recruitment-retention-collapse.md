# Care Worker Shortage Impossible Recruitment Retention Collapse

Professional care workforce shortage reaches 15-20M globally (2030) growing to 30-40M (2040) as care worker demand increases 3-5% annually while supply grows <1% due to low wages ($25K-35K annually), poor conditions (high injury rates 5-10× other jobs, emotional burnout 60-80% annual turnover), and status degradation, where recruitment impossibility emerges as care jobs require empathy/skill but offer poverty wages ensuring only desperate/exploited workers accept positions creating permanent shortage despite massive unmet demand.
