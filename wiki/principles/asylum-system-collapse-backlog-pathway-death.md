# Asylum System Collapse Backlog Pathway Death

1951 UN Convention design for thousands post-WWII → 2024 120M forcibly displaced → US 3M+ backlog 5-7yr wait (2015 500k, 2yr wait) → judge shortage (need 5-10× capacity) → approval <20% threshold triggers legal pathway abandonment → smuggling surge fills gap (wait >3yr = document expiry, pathway viability collapse, reversibility requires decade-scale investment)
