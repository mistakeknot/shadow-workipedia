# Climate Contamination Mobilization Spread Cascade

Climate change amplifies contamination through multiple pathways: flooding inundates Superfund sites spreading plumes beyond containment, wildfires volatilize metals depositing over wider areas, permafrost thaw releases frozen industrial waste, coastal erosion exposes buried contamination, and extreme precipitation increases erosion transport and groundwater mobility, transforming static legacy pollution into dynamic spreading crisis that overwhelms existing containment/monitoring infrastructure and makes cleanup moving-target impossible.
