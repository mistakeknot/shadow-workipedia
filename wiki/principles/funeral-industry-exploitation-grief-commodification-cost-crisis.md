# Funeral Industry Exploitation Grief Commodification Cost Crisis

Death care costs reach $15K-30K average funeral (US) from $5K-10K (2000) rising 5-7% annually vs inflation 2-3%, where funeral industry consolidation (Service Corporation International controls 15% US market) enables price gouging on grieving families who face time-sensitive decisions under emotional duress, and regulatory capture prevents transparency (price disclosure laws unenforced, embalming legally unnecessary but culturally coerced) creating exploitation crisis where 30-50% families go into debt for funerals and low-income communities face indignity of mass graves or cremation-only options.
