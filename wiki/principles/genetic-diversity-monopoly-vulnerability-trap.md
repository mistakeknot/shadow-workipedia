# Genetic Diversity Monopoly Vulnerability Trap

Seed industry consolidation (top 4 companies 60% market share: Bayer 25%, patent concentration 20%→80%, farmer dependency 10%→90% buying annually) drives 75% agricultural diversity loss since 1900 (wheat 30,000→1,000 varieties, USA 93% vegetable seeds extinct since 1903), creating monoculture disease/climate shock catastrophic vulnerability when genetic diversity <10% baseline + seed monopoly >80% + seed saving criminalized >70% jurisdictions (Monsanto lawsuits $23M 1997-2010, GURT terminator tech).
