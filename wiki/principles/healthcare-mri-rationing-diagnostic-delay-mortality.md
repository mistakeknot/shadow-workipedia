# Healthcare MRI Rationing Diagnostic Delay Mortality

40,000+ MRI machines globally + 1.5-3T magnets need 1,700L liquid helium + 5-10% boil-off annually → helium shortage → hospitals compete for limited supply → some lose cooling → magnet quench (lose superconductivity) requiring expensive recharge → MRI wait times 3× normal during shortages → cancer/stroke diagnosis delayed → worse outcomes → pressure for allocation → political intervention → market distortion (healthcare vs industry allocation = lives vs economics)
