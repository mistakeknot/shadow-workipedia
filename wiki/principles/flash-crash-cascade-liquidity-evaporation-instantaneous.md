# Flash Crash Cascade Liquidity Evaporation Instantaneous

May 6, 2010: Dow -9.2% in 5 minutes (1,000 points) → recovered 20 minutes → $1 trillion market cap evaporated temporarily → cause: algorithmic feedback loops + liquidity withdrawal → HFT provides liquidity only when profitable → stress conditions = HFT withdraws → no market makers → prices discover vacuum → circuit breakers implemented but outdated (single-stock, not cross-market) → 2015 flash crash, 2016 sterling crash, 2019 bond flash crash → frequency increasing as algorithms proliferate.
