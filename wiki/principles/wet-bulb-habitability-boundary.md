# Wet Bulb Habitability Boundary

Humid regions approaching 35°C wet-bulb threshold create >1-in-1000 year extreme heat events (2021 Pacific NW: 49.6°C, 1,400 deaths) establishing physiological limits on outdoor labor, triggering cascading crop failure, rural exodus, and political instability as regions transition to uninhabitable status.
