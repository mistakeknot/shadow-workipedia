# Captive Audience Psychological Warfare Effectiveness

Mandatory anti-union meetings deployed in 80% of campaigns (2010-2023 EPI) use psychological tactics (fear induction job loss/plant closure, isolation "unions are third parties", confusion dues/strikes misinfo, supervisor intimidation one-on-ones) achieving 20-40% swing in pro-union vote depending on frequency/intensity/worker vulnerability → worker vulnerability multipliers (immigration status 2×, debt >60% income 1.5×, single parents 1.8×, no savings 1.4×) → frequency escalation (1-2 meetings typical → 5-10 intense Amazon → daily JFK8) → Amazon Bessemer 71% initial support polled → lost 738-1,798 after intense campaign → legal status (mandatory attendance legal, Babcock rule excludes outside organizers, state bans California/Oregon preempted by NLRA) creating systematic exploitation where employers target workers' economic insecurity and isolation to induce paralyzing fear suppressing collective action even when majority initially support union.
