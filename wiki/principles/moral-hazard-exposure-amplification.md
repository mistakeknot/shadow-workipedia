# Moral Hazard Exposure Amplification

Subsidized government insurance premiums (NFIP 40-60% below actuarial rates) incentivize rebuilding in high-risk zones creating "repetitive loss" concentration (1% of NFIP policies = 30% of claims, beach houses flooded 5-10× still insured) → coastal development accelerates faster than premium collection → exposure grows 5-10% annually → catastrophic losses compound → government program solvency doom loop (NFIP $20B debt 2024 → $50B-$100B projected by 2035).
