# VPN Mesh Darknet Surge

Underground network adoption escalates as censorship intensifies (VPN usage 25% baseline 2020 → 40% 2025 → 60% 2030 → 80% 2040 in authoritarian blocs) with state blocking effectiveness varying (China GFW 0.70-0.80, Russia DPI 0.60-0.70, Iran 0.80-0.90) driving darknet market growth 10-25x by 2030 ($1B-$2B → $10B-$50B) and 100-500x by 2040 as mesh becomes parallel internet enabling both dissidents and criminals equally.
