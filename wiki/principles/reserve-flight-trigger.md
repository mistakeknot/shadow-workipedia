# Reserve Flight Trigger

Foreign currency reserves <3 months imports create structural capital flight tipping point where 5-10% exchange rate depreciation expectations trigger 20-40% deposit outflows within weeks, exhausting reserves within 1-3 months, forcing Banco Central to raise rates 5-15% to defend currency (Brazil 2020: 10.5% rates) or abandon peg, amplified by dollarization lock-in where 40-60% of deposits already foreign-denominated, seen in Argentina 2019-2023 (reserves collapsed from $50B to $8B in 18 months)
