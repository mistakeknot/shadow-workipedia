# Low Probability High Consequence Certainty

Supervolcanic eruptions (VEI 7-8) are geologically inevitable—Yellowstone, Toba, Taupo have erupted repeatedly over millions of years, meaning the question is not "if" but "when," with probability ~0.1% per century but consequences civilization-threatening.
