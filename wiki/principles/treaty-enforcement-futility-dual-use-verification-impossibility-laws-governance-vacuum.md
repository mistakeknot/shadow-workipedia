# Treaty Enforcement Futility Dual Use Verification Impossibility LAWS Governance Vacuum

Autonomous weapons arms control faces verification impossibility as dual-use technology (commercial drones, computer vision, machine learning) has no unique signatures distinguishing civilian from military applications, where software modifications enabling autonomous targeting require only code changes (zero physical infrastructure) undetectable by inspection, and meaningful human control definition remains disputed (2-second loop vs 20-minute oversight) preventing consensus on prohibition scope, creating governance vacuum where LAWS proliferation ungovernable, treaty compliance unverifiable, and international humanitarian law unenforceable ensuring permanent regulatory failure.
