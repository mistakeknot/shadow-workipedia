# Permanent Atmospheric Escape Non Renewable Depletion

Helium rises through atmosphere and escapes Earth's gravity → byproduct of radioactive decay over billions of years, trapped in natural gas → once released, permanently lost → 6 billion cubic feet/year consumption (growing 3-5% annually) → 15-25 years reserves at current rates → every helium balloon = tiny permanent depletion → US Federal Helium Reserve 1 billion cubic feet depleting since 1990s privatization (unlike other resources, true non-renewability on human timescales)
