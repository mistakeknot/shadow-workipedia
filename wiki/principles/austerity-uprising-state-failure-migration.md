# Austerity Uprising State Failure Migration

IMF austerity (40% cuts) × inequality (30% Gini) × disaster severity (30% GDP shock) creates regime change probability threshold → protest/strike waves → military coups or revolutionary movements → state failure when fiscal collapse + political instability + migration pressure converge → living standards collapse drives 10-50M climate refugees → brain drain (skilled workers >5-10% workforce exit) creates remittance dependence (>10-20% GDP) → domestic economy structurally weakens → more migration in compounding cascade → diaspora remittances prop up failing state creating permanent dependency while state capacity erodes → when austerity cuts exceed 20-30% AND inequality is high popular uprisings become likely triggering authoritarian crackdowns or regime collapse.
