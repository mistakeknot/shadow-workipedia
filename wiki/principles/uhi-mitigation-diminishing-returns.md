# UHI Mitigation Diminishing Returns

Urban heat island >10°C becomes economically infeasible to mitigate (tree planting 0.10 canopy → -0.5°C, cool roofs albedo 0.40 → -2-3°C, combined effects reduce UHI max 3-4°C from 10°C+ baseline) when density >10,000/km² + albedo 0.05-0.10 + green space <0.05 + buildings >50 years remaining life, locking adaptation-only path for 50+ years and forcing cooling demand +200-300% per capita driving grid upgrade costs $100-200B (major city) politically unsustainable without sustained crisis trigger
