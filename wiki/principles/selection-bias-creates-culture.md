# Selection Bias Creates Culture

Colonist selection criteria (technical skills, psychological resilience, health standards, wealth for ticket) create demographically skewed founding populations that establish path-dependent cultural and political trajectories—measured by founder effect magnitude (initial population <1,000 determines centuries of culture), demographic skew indices (age, education, wealth, ideology), and cultural drift rate vs. Earth baseline.
