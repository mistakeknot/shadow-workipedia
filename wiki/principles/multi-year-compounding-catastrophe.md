# Multi Year Compounding Catastrophe

Learning loss from pandemic school closures (2020-2022) compounds over time—students who missed foundational skills (reading in grades 1-3, math in grades 4-6) cannot master advanced material, creating widening achievement gaps that persist for decades and may never fully recover, with NAEP data showing 4-8 month learning loss accelerating rather than recovering.
