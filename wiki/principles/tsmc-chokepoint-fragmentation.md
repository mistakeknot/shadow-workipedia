# TSMC Chokepoint Fragmentation

92% of advanced chips (<7nm) from single source Taiwan creates geopolitical vulnerability where US export controls (CHIPS Act <7nm ban 2022) trigger Chinese retaliation spiral (rare earths 60% supply → gallium 80% → germanium 60% → sabotage) with 70% per-round escalation probability leading to parallel AI ecosystems and Cold War 2.0 decoupling after 5+ rounds.
