# Skyglow Expansion Exponential Darkness Extinction

Artificial light at night (ALAN) increasing 2-6% annually globally → 80% of world population lives under light-polluted skies → 99% of US/EU cannot see Milky Way → skyglow radius around cities expanding 10-15 km/decade → "darkness extinction": children born today in cities may never experience true night → LED transition 2010-2025 increased blue-spectrum pollution 2-3× → light trespass into homes ubiquitous → no international treaty, no enforcement, no measurement standards.
