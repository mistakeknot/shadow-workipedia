# Temperature Threshold Breach Speciation

Pathogenic fungi evolve mammalian thermal tolerance as global temperatures narrow the gap between soil warmth and human body heat. Candida auris emerged after 2009, likely evolved in Asian wetlands warmed past 35°C—bridging the thermal barrier that historically protected warm-blooded animals from fungal infection.
