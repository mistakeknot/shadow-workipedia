# Payment For Order Flow Information Asymmetry Front Running

Citadel/Virtu pay $2.6B/year to brokers for retail order flow → see orders 10-100ms before execution → profitable 97% of trading days → "price improvement" narrative masks reality: HFTs extract $1-3/order → market makers know retail is "dumb money" → adverse selection: retail buys at ask, sells at bid, pays spread both ways → information asymmetry compounds: institutions see aggregate retail positioning → trade against it → retail systematically loses to better-informed counterparties.
