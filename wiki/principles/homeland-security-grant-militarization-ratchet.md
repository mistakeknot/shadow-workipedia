# Homeland Security Grant Militarization Ratchet

Post-9/11 homeland security grants $35B (2002-2012) flow to urban police departments for armored vehicles, drones, surveillance creating one-way ratchet where equipment acquisition is easy (1033 program ships MRAPs for $1-2k shipping cost, 11,500 agencies participated by 2014) but demilitarization politically impossible (police unions resist "tying our hands", "Ferguson effect" claims, Blue Mutiny threats: officers resign/refuse if equipment removed) → equipment sits unused (Concord NH pop. 42k armored vehicle "for pumpkin festival") draining budgets via 3-5× maintenance costs → fiscal waste + warrior culture institutionalization.
