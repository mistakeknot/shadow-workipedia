# Metabolic Stratification Lifespan Divergence

Obesity by income quintile diverges → wealthy maintain healthy weight (GLP-1, quality food, walkability) → poor obese (food deserts, cheap UPF, car dependence) → 15-year lifespan gap by 2024 → intergenerational transmission → biological class divide (metabolic health becomes class marker, wealthy live 15+ years longer, poor die young from obesity-related disease, permanent biological underclass)
