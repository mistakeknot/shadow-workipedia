# Deplatforming Cascading Coordinated Permanent Exclusion

Platform deplatforming operates through cascade where initial exclusion from one service (Twitter ban) triggers coordinated removal across ecosystem (YouTube, Facebook, payment processors, cloud hosting, app stores) within 24-72 hours, as demonstrated by Alex Jones (2018), Parler (2021), and Canadian trucker donors (2022), creating permanent exclusion impossible to appeal as platforms coordinate blacklisting and alternative infrastructure (banking, hosting, payment processing) denies service to deplatformed individuals/organizations ensuring no viable workaround and establishing extrajudicial punishment through private sector coordination.
