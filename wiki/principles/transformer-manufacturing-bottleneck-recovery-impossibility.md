# Transformer Manufacturing Bottleneck Recovery Impossibility

Carrington-Class CME (1% annual probability at solar maximum, Dst -1200 to -1760 nT) induces geomagnetically-induced currents 150-300 amps DC through AC transformers → core saturation → thermal runaway → 628 EHV transformers destroyed simultaneously (US grid 345 kV+) → manufacturing bottleneck 3 global vendors (ABB, Siemens, Hyundai) produce 30 units/year combined capacity, 12-24 month lead time, $10M-$50M each, 300+ tons custom-built → recovery timeline 628 destroyed ÷ 30/year = 21-year replacement queue → economic collapse during recovery prevents financing → regions without power for 10-20 years creating effectively permanent infrastructure destruction where manufacturing constraints make catastrophic damage irreversible within political/economic timeframes relevant to civilization continuity (21 years = generation-long blackout triggers mass migration, government collapse 56% probability).
