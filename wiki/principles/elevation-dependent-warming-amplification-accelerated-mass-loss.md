# Elevation Dependent Warming Amplification Accelerated Mass Loss

Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau experiences 2-3× faster warming than global average (0.3-0.7°C/decade vs 0.18°C global) due to elevation-dependent temperature amplification, 100,000 km² glaciers losing 8 billion tons ice/year (2000-2016) accelerating to 12 billion tons/year (2016-2024), black carbon deposition reducing albedo from 0.7 (clean) to 0.4 (polluted) driving positive feedback, feeding 10 major Asian rivers sustaining 2 billion people (30% humanity) creating unprecedented collapse timeline.
