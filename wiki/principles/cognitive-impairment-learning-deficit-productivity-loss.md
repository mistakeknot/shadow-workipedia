# Cognitive Impairment Learning Deficit Productivity Loss

Children in noisy schools: -1 month reading progress per 5 dB increase → aircraft noise corridors: measurable IQ deficits → workplace noise >65 dB: productivity -10-15%, error rates +15-25% → chronic noise exposure: attention deficits, memory impairment, cognitive fatigue → hospital noise (typically 70-80 dB vs 35 dB recommended): delayed recovery, medication errors → economic cost: $3.9B/year US workplace productivity loss.
