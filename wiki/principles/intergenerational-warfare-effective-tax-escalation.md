# Intergenerational Warfare Effective Tax Escalation

Youth awareness spreads via social media that effective tax rates >50% fund boomer retirements they'll never receive themselves (4-2-1 problem: one child supporting two parents + four grandparents in China), escalating through "OK Boomer" resentment→tax resistance (gray economy growth)→political revolt (parties demanding retroactive benefit cuts)→potential revolution (complete social contract breakdown) when youth unemployment hits 60% (Greece) while funding generous early retirements (58→67 age raises under troika) for generation that destroyed their future prospects.
