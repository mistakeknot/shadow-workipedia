# Industrial Regenerative Transition Window Closure

Industrial agriculture soil-mining practices (tillage 10-100× erosion, monoculture 2-5× pest vulnerability, chemical dependency, machinery compaction 30-70% infiltration reduction) lock farmers into degradation spiral via debt trap + seed contracts, while regenerative alternatives (no-till 90% erosion reduction, cover crops +50% organic matter over 10 years, rotation +30% yield stability) face adoption barriers ($100-$500/acre upfront, 3-5 year yield dip, 80% farmers lack training, corporate pressure) keeping adoption <10% insufficient to avoid industrial >80% cropland lock-in before soil organic matter <1% irreversibility 2040-2060.
