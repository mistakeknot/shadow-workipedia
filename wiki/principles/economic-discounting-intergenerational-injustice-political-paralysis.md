# Economic Discounting Intergenerational Injustice Political Paralysis

Multi-century commitment timescales (2035 trigger → 2300 equilibrium) encounter economic discounting where standard 2-3% discount rate transforms $10T damage 2100 into $1-2T present value 2024 and $100T damage 2300 into $0.1-$1T present value creating systematic underweighting future catastrophe where rational economic analysis suggests delay adaptation (net present value negative if spent today) despite physical certainty collapse and political horizons 2-4 year election cycles vs 30-year commitment decision window producing politician incentive ignore long-term (voters punish present costs, don't reward prevented future disasters) and intergenerational equity failure where current generation consumes fossil fuels (economic benefits now), future generations pay sea level rise costs (displacement, infrastructure loss) but future generations cannot vote today's elections creating representation asymmetry and moral hazard cascade where each decade's delay (2025, 2030, 2035) preserves current prosperity (avoid $5T adaptation spending) while marginally increasing future catastrophe ($10T → $11T → $12T) but exponential growth future damages means delay crosses threshold (2040+) where adaptation costs exceed prevention costs but commitment already locked creating permanent regret equilibrium where optimal action was 2025-2035 but political economy systematically prevents timely response.
