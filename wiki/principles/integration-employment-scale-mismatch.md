# Integration Employment Scale Mismatch

Solar-on-reclaimed-mines reinvestment programs create 100s of jobs (symbolic cultural win) but coal industry shed 136k jobs (178k→42k 1985-2020), where 100:1 scale mismatch makes "just transition" structurally impossible to deliver equivalent employment, forcing choice between honest managed decline (political suicide, worker abandonment) or false promise betrayal (Trump coal revival failure) that both produce radicalization but through different betrayal mechanics
