# Pandemic Preparedness Decay Institutional Memory Loss

COVID lessons abandoned as stockpiles deplete/expire without replacement, workforce PTSD prevents return for next crisis, public trust erosion makes compliance impossible (vaccine hesitancy, political polarization), hospital financial fragility eliminates surge capacity, and experienced staff exodus causes institutional memory loss (protocols, coordination structures, training programs dissolved), leaving healthcare system weaker post-COVID than pre-COVID despite $5T spending and 1.2M deaths, ensuring next pandemic faces worse initial conditions and collapsed response capability.
