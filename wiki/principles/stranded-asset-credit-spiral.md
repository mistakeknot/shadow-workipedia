# Stranded Asset Credit Spiral

Asset write-downs >$100B trigger credit rating downgrades (investment→junk 3-step cascade), where refinancing becomes impossible at >8% rates forcing 40+ bankruptcies (2015-2020 calibration), while diversification attempts fail because 85-95% capital still allocated to fossil projects creating corporate extinction trap where transition is too slow but retreat too late
