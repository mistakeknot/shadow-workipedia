# Trust Erosion Irreversibility

Media trust collapses from 72% baseline (1950) → 54% (1997) → 32% (2024) → <20% crisis threshold (2040) via partisan polarization (Republicans 70% → 14%, Democrats stable 70-76% 1997-2022), institutional journalism death spiral (newspaper revenue $46B → $6B 2005-2022, 2,500+ closures, -80% investigative capacity), and expertise devaluation (scientists/doctors harassment), with truth recovery requiring years-decades timescale while disinformation operates at viral-hours speed, creating irreversible epistemic collapse.
