# Iatrogenic Catastrophe Irreversibility Brain Surgery Mortality

BCI implantation requires invasive neurosurgery (craniotomy, electrode insertion, chronic inflammation management) carrying mortality risk 0.5-2% per procedure and explantation risk 2-5% for device failures or infections, where 100M global users (2040) implies 500K-2M surgical deaths and 2M-5M explantation complications creating permanent disability, as neural tissue damage from electrode placement proves irreversible (scar tissue, neural degeneration, cognitive deficits) and infection risk (meningitis, brain abscess) remains 1-3% annually ensuring that mass BCI adoption creates ongoing humanitarian crisis comparable to 500K-1M annual deaths with no medical reversal possible.
