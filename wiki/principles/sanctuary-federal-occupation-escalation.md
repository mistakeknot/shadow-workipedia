# Sanctuary Federal Occupation Escalation

Sanctuary policies (500+ jurisdictions refuse ICE detainer requests, prohibit local police cooperation) create federal-local conflict → federal funding threats ($27B withheld, courts block but Trump ignores) → ICE operates without local support → community trust erosion (crime reporting -10-30%, witness cooperation declines) undermines public safety → federal occupation threat (Portland 2020 DHS agents precedent → San Francisco 2025+ scenario) where agents deployed without consent arrest city officials + seize police facilities → constitutional crisis (10th Amendment states' rights, Posse Comitatus military prohibition) → civil disobedience (massive protests, federal agents attacked) vs militia counter-protests (armed groups hunt undocumented, vigilante violence 5-15 incidents/year) creating breakdown of federal-state relations.
