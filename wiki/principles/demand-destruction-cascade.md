# Demand Destruction Cascade

Peak oil demand (2030-2035) when EV adoption >30% + carbon pricing $50/ton creates -20M bbl/day decline (2020-2040) forcing price collapse $100→$40, where marginal projects become uneconomic below $60/barrel triggering stranded asset write-downs $100B+ and 40% of reserves permanently worthless, creating irreversible industry contraction regardless of policy reversals
