# Pronatalist Policy Futility TFR Recovery Impossibility

Pronatalist policies (cash payments, childcare subsidies, parental leave) costing 2-5% GDP achieve TFR increases only 0.1-0.3 points (France 1.8→2.0, Sweden 1.5→1.7) far below replacement 2.1, where structural drivers (female education, urbanization, childcare costs $15-30K/year, housing unaffordability) override financial incentives as even generous policies ($50K+ lifetime per child) insufficient to change childbearing decisions, establishing policy futility where $1-3T spending (10% GDP over 20 years) achieves marginal impact ensuring demographic collapse inevitable regardless of intervention.
