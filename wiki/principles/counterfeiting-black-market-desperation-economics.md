# Counterfeiting Black Market Desperation Economics

Shortage severity threshold → black market emergence → counterfeit detection rates insufficient → patient desperation indices rise → quality-related mortality → trust collapse indicators → Valsartan contamination precedent (legitimate supply contaminated, what else?) → shortage = demand for any source, quality verification impossible under pressure, illicit supply chains fill gap, patient harm from fake/substandard drugs (shortage creates secondary mortality pathway)
