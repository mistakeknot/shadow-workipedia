# Methane Super Emitter Concentration Detection Gap

280-450kt CH4/year US orphaned wells → 5% super-emitters produce 50%+ emissions → emission rates 0.1-1kg/hour average, 10-100kg/hour super-emitters → 20-year CO2e 22-36M tonnes/year → satellite detection (TROPOMI, GHGSat) identifies large sources → comprehensive survey cost-prohibitive → most wells never surveyed post-abandonment (finding super-emitters maximizes reduction, but requires systematic search nobody funds)
