# Treatment First

Mandatory sobriety before housing, no pets, couples separated, strict curfew, ID required, effective capacity = nominal × 0.40 (barriers exclude 60%), 65% dropout rate, 25% ultimately housed (35% complete × 70% placement), cost $25k/year (treatment expensive), relapse mortality 80 per 1000/year (forced sobriety increases overdose risk after relapse), public support "common sense" requirement
   - **Trade-off**: Proven outcomes (Housing First 85% retention Utah/Houston/Finland) vs public intuition (treatment first "makes sense" despite 65% dropout), cost effectiveness ($15k vs $25k) vs political palatability (mandatory sobriety polls well), harm reduction philosophy (housing stabilizes then address addiction) vs sequential model (sobriety prerequisite for housing), evidence-based policy (data shows barriers reduce effectiveness) vs moral framing (shouldn't enable addiction)
