# WetBulb Mortality Threshold

35°C fatal limit (body cannot cool via sweating, core temperature rises, death in 6 hours) creates non-linear mortality cliff where wet bulb 32-35°C yields 10-40 deaths/100k/day baseline, exceeding 35°C = 50+/100k/day with no AC mitigation possible, making physiological catastrophe irreversible once urban heat island +8-12°C combines with climate warming +3-4°C in South Asia/Middle East by 2070-2080
