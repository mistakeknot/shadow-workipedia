# Training Pipeline Mismatch Decade Lag

Medical education takes 10-15 years (physician), 4-6 years (nurse). Workforce shortages today reflect decisions made a decade ago. Training capacity constraints (faculty, clinical sites, funding) mean even urgent investment takes years to increase supply. Importing workers is faster but ethically fraught and politically contested.
