# Permafrost Methane Mobilization

5-15 kg carbon/m² release per meter of active layer thaw creating positive feedback loop where permafrost emissions (+0.75°C independent warming) trigger further thaw, potentially mobilizing 1,700 Gt CO₂-equivalent and pushing Earth system past Hothouse equilibrium.
