# Trade Route Seeding Cascade

Cross-border transmission via commercial networks seeds new regional epidemics with 7-14 day lag from source infection, creating wave pattern where GDP loss multipliers compound (+15-25% per sector per month of lockdown) and supply chain disruptions create 6-12 month cascade failures in dependent economies, amplifying pandemic duration by 40-60%.
