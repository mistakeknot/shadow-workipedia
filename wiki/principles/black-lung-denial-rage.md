10k+ active cases with treatment costs $50k-$200k/case face 60% claim denial rate (2010-2020) due to industry-funded medical reviews, creating $6B compensation fund insolvency while coal executives display $100M+ wealth (4th yacht purchases), where denial → courthouse protests → property damage → crackdowns accumulate into assassination probability 0.01/year (low but catalytic) when accumulated grievances (layoffs + disease + environmental destruction) exceed tolerance threshold
