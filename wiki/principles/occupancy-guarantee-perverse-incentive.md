# Occupancy Guarantee Perverse Incentive

Private prison occupancy guarantee contracts (80-100% minimum occupancy, government pays for empty beds) create perverse fiscal incentives where states pay for vacancies (Louisiana 2014: $24M paid for empty beds, 90% guarantee vs 55% actual occupancy) → pressure to maintain high incarceration rates → lobbying for criminalization of minor offenses (immigration detention boom via Arizona HB 1070 2010 "Show Me Your Papers" law + ALEC $2M lobbying → +25% detention demand → +$150M private prison revenue) → prison labor exploitation ($0.12-$0.40/hour wages, products sold at market rates 37-125× markup, $2B/year industry) → economic dependency on mass incarceration infrastructure resisting reform.
