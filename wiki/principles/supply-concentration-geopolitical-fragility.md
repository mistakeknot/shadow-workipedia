# Supply Concentration Geopolitical Fragility

75% from 3 sources (US 40%, Qatar 25%, Russia 15%) → Qatar 2017 diplomatic blockade threatened 25% global supply → prices spiked 30%, hospitals rationed → Russia sanctions uncertainty over 15% supply → single plant vulnerability (RasGas) → $3/mcf (2000) → $14/mcf (2023) → projected $50+/mcf by 2035 → price spikes 200-400% during disruptions (concentration = fragility, geopolitics = supply shock)
