# Climate Nuclear Waste Deadlock Fossil Lock In

Climate crisis demands replacing fossil fuels with nuclear baseload power (only zero-carbon dispatchable generation) but nuclear expansion blocked by unsolved waste problem (no permanent repository after 80 years, public opposition from pool fire risks, NIMBY preventing transport/siting), creating impossible trilemma where build reactors = more unsolvable waste, don't build = fossil fuel lock-in = climate catastrophe, maintain status quo = pool failures inevitable, ensuring climate disaster from waste management paralysis.
