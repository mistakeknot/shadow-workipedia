# Consciousness Test Epistemology Fundamental Uncertainty

IIT Φ quantification + GWT global workspace + Turing variants → academic consensus 55-70% (slight majority) → false positive rate 10-20% (non-conscious pass) + false negative rate 10% (conscious fail) → corporate funding asymmetry $500M pro vs $2B anti → test gaming vulnerability → we don't know what consciousness IS, let alone how to detect it in silico → epistemological fog (players never KNOW if AIs are conscious, must decide under uncertainty, live with consequences)
