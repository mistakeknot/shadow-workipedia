# Geographic Proximity Amplification

Conflict probability increases 4-8x for immediately adjacent countries (shared border or <200km) versus distant powers (>2000km) controlling for equivalent threat levels, because neighbors face lower mobilization costs and faster response requirements creating 30-40% baseline conflict probability versus <5% for >10,000km separation even under sustained rivalry.
