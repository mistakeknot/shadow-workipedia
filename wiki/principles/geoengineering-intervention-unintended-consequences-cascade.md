# Geoengineering Intervention Unintended Consequences Cascade

AMOC collapse mitigation attempts using Arctic aerosols (sulfate injection reduce Greenland melt -20-40% slowing freshwater input), artificial mixing (subsurface pumps restore deep water formation $50B-$100B infrastructure), Greenland ice preservation (reflective films/snow machines $100B-$500B deployment) face failure modes where Arctic aerosols disrupt other monsoon systems (Indian monsoon -10-30% precipitation affecting 1B+ South Asia, East Asian monsoon shifts affecting China agriculture), coral bleaching acceleration (rapid cooling thermal stress), ozone depletion (sulfate chemistry), unintended teleconnections (Pacific trade winds, El Niño frequency) creating cascading regional impacts potentially worse than AMOC collapse itself and artificial mixing encounters engineering limits (energy requirements 100-500 GW continuous power equivalent 100-500 nuclear reactors economically unviable, ecological disruption deep ocean ecosystems, effectiveness uncertainty ±50% whether restores circulation) plus termination shock where geoengineering cessation (political collapse, funding loss, sabotage) causes rebound collapse faster than original trajectory and governance impossibility where AMOC intervention requires global coordination (Arctic states Russia/Canada/US/Nordic cooperation) but competing interests (Russia benefits from Arctic shipping, Europe desperate for intervention, US isolationist resistance) prevent sustained 50-200 year commitment needed for AMOC recovery creating intervention failure where short-term geoengineering (10-20 years) masks problem without solving enabling complacency then catastrophic rebound when terminated producing worse outcome than no intervention.
