## Overview
**Pattern:** `lock-in`
**Mechanic:** `Lock-In`

Once committed, systems resist change due to costs, compatibility, contracts, institutional inertia, or accumulated infrastructure. Early choices constrain future options; switching costs make reversals hard.

This mechanic consolidates: lock-in-effect, economic-lock-in, path-dependency.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Flexibility, optionality, ability to pivot
- **Drivers:** Initial investments, network effects, contractual obligations, sunk costs, institutional momentum
- **Outcomes:** Incumbents benefit from barriers to entry; society pays via reduced innovation, suboptimal equilibria

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** High switching costs, legacy infrastructure dependency, vendor concentration
- **Levers:** Interoperability mandates, open standards, sunset clauses, migration subsidies
- **Failure modes:** Technological dead-ends, stranded assets, zombie industries protected by inertia

## Notes
- Path dependency is the historical dimension of lock-in (early choices → constrained futures)
- Economic lock-in is lock-in in market contexts (vendor lock-in, platform dependency)
- All describe the same causal structure: resistance to change after commitment
