## Overview
**Pattern:** `threshold`
**Mechanic:** `Threshold`

A nonlinear trigger: behavior changes discontinuously once a variable crosses a critical value. Includes tipping points (often irreversible regime shifts).

This mechanic consolidates: threshold, tipping-point.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** System regime, equilibrium state
- **Drivers:** Cumulative pressure on key variables approaching critical values
- **Outcomes:** Phase transitions, regime shifts, cascade triggers

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Variables approaching known thresholds, early warning indicators
- **Levers:** Buffer maintenance, threshold monitoring, preventive intervention
- **Failure modes:** Irreversible transitions, hysteresis preventing recovery

## Notes
- Tipping points are thresholds with irreversibility/hysteresis
- Both describe the same causal structure: nonlinear discontinuous change at critical values
- Identify the tracked variable, threshold value, and reversibility
