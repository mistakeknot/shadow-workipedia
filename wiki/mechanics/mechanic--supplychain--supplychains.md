## Overview
**Pattern:** `supplychain`
**Mechanic:** `supplyChains`

Interdependence across suppliers and logistics creates propagation of shocks, bottlenecks, and systemic fragility.

This page documents **Supply Chains** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- What is the “state” or resource this mechanic changes?
- What are the main drivers/inputs?
- What are the outcomes/outputs (who benefits, who pays, what breaks)?

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** What would make this mechanic “activate” or intensify?
- **Levers:** What interventions can players apply (policy, spending, coordination, enforcement)?
- **Failure modes:** What happens if this is ignored or mismanaged?

## Notes
- List chokepoints and substitution options (elasticity).
- Track propagation speed (inventory days, lead times).
