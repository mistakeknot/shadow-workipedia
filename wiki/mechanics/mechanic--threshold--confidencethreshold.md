## Overview
**Pattern:** `threshold`
**Mechanic:** `confidenceThreshold`

A nonlinear trigger: behavior changes once a variable crosses a critical threshold.

This page documents **Confidence Threshold** as it appears in System Walk subsystems and suggests how to represent it consistently in the simulation/UI.

## How it works
- What is the “state” or resource this mechanic changes?
- What are the main drivers/inputs?
- What are the outcomes/outputs (who benefits, who pays, what breaks)?

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** What would make this mechanic “activate” or intensify?
- **Levers:** What interventions can players apply (policy, spending, coordination, enforcement)?
- **Failure modes:** What happens if this is ignored or mismanaged?

## Notes
- Identify the tracked variable and its threshold(s).
- Clarify whether crossing is one-way (hysteresis) or reversible.
