## Overview
**Pattern:** `concentration`
**Mechanic:** `Concentration`

Critical dependencies or vulnerabilities concentrated in few locations, entities, or chokepoints. Single points of failure that amplify systemic risk.

This mechanic consolidates: geographic-concentration, chokepoint-concentration, environmental-justice-concentration.

## How it works
- **State/Resource:** Resilience, redundancy, distributed capacity
- **Drivers:** Efficiency optimization, economies of scale, natural resource distribution, historical accident
- **Outcomes:** Lower costs during normal times; catastrophic risk during disruptions; power concentration in gatekeepers

## In the simulation
- **Signals:** Market share concentration (HHI), geographic clustering, supplier dependency ratios
- **Levers:** Antitrust action, strategic reserves, diversification incentives, distributed infrastructure investment
- **Failure modes:** Cascade failures from single-point disruptions, supply shocks, coercive leverage by controllers

## Notes
- Geographic concentration: physical clustering (e.g., semiconductor fabs in Taiwan)
- Chokepoint concentration: flow bottlenecks (e.g., Strait of Hormuz, SWIFT)
- Environmental justice concentration: harm clustering in vulnerable communities
- All describe the same causal structure: concentrated vulnerability
